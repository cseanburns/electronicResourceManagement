<p>I think it's fair to claim
that current copyright laws
heavily influence the price
of electronic resources, and
in this section,
we cover the basics of copyright,
how copyright creates monopolies, and
how those monopolies,
in the digital era, are
able to demand substantial sums of 
money for electronic resources, and
finally, how this impacts
library budgets.</p>
<p>Below I'll discuss copyright and
the first sale doctrine,
I show how digital works
have disrupted some basic
ways that libraries function.
Then I'll discuss the impact
that this law has on complicated
e-resource collections and costs.</p>
<h3 id="copyright"><a class="header" href="#copyright">Copyright</a></h3>
<p>Copyright law grants a monopoly
to the person or corporate owner
of an intellectual property.
That is, copyright owners have
exclusive rights over the material
that they own,
where the owners may be
a person or an organizational entity.
Section 106 of the law grants
copyright owners the following rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;</p>
<p>(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;</p>
<p>(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;</p>
<p>(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the
copyrighted work publicly;</p>
<p>(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the
individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display
the copyrighted work publicly; and</p>
<p>(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly
by means of a digital audio transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106">Copyright Section 106</a></p>
<p>These exclusive and all-encompassing
rights are designed to allow
copyright owners a monopoly
of their property.
While it is good to incentivize
the creation of intellectual property,
without restrictions,
there would be little to no
benefit to the public.
For example,
if those exclusive rights
were followed without limitation,
then it would mean that the
exchange of money
for a work between a
copyright holder and a buyer
for something like a
printed book or a DVD
would not entail a transfer
of ownership of that physical copy;
that is, it would not allow
the buyer of the physical item
any distribution rights
of the item once the
first exchange has been made.
Under such a scenario,
libraries would be able to buy physical
books but would not be able to lend them.</p>
<p>To address this,
the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#109">First Sale Doctrine</a>
(also see the
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1854-copyright-infringement-first-sale-doctrine">Justice Department's explanation</a>)
helps avoid the issue granted by the
list of exclusive rights
listed in Section 106.
Because of the first sale doctrine,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbs-Merrill_Co._v._Straus">made precedent in the early 20th century</a> and
then <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/">codified into law in 1976</a>,
you, I, or a library
may buy a physical copy of a work,
like a book, a DVD, a painting, and
literally own that specific copy.
First sale doctrine does not
grant us reproduction rights,
as listed in
<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106">Section 106</a>
of the 1976 copyright law, but
it does allow us to distribute
the singular, physical representation or
embodiment of the work
that we have purchased.
Thus, the first sale doctrine
is why libraries were able to thrive
throughout the 20th century,
lend material, and preserve it.
More mundanely, it's also why
I can buy a book at a bookstore and
later give it away or sell it to someone. </p>
<p>The digital medium
makes things messier,
as it tends to do.
There are two big reasons for this.
First, digital works are not
subject to the same distribution
constraints as physical works are, and
the first sale doctrine is
about distribution rights and
not reproduction rights.
If I have a physical copy of
some book and give you
my copy of that book,
then I no longer have that copy.
However, if I have a copy
of a digital file, then
as we all know,
it is relatively
trivial to share that file
with you without losing
access to my own copy.
Since digital works
can be copied and distributed without
losing access to the copies or
to the original,
the First Sale Doctrine does not
necessarily apply
to digital copies.
Consequently,
in the digital space,
there are fewer limitations on supply,
including on lending.</p>
<p>Second, many digital works
are like software,
or at least,
they are intertwined
with the software and hardware needed
to display them.
This is true for all kinds of documents,
like HTML pages,
which need a web browser or
a text editor to read them;
or audio files,
which need a media player
to listen to them.
But consider ebooks as an example.
Whether a printed book is
the size of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto">quarto</a>
or as large as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio">folio</a>,
whether it is all text,
whether it includes images,
or whether it has pop-ups
makes no difference to its
basic distribution potential and
ergo its copyright status.
These physical works are,
in essence,
self-contained.
Ebooks, however, arrive in
all shapes and sizes.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>
distributes public domain ebooks in 
various file formats
that include plain text documents,
that have no presentation markup
like bold, italics, and like,
HTML documents with markup,
XML documents like EPUB, and
then also PDFs and others.
Why so many file formats?
Text is text, right?
In the print space,
a book is simply text
printed on pages of paper,
even if it is sometimes printed
on different sized pages or
using different type settings.
But these various markups
exist because they each offer
technological or presentational advantages and
are often tied to specific
pieces of software and hardware.</p>
<p>This is especially true
for proprietary, encrypted file formats,
like the ones that Amazon created
for use only on Kindles
(other e-reader and other stores also), or
the popular MP3 file format for
audio recordings that only recently
became patent free.
While file formats like these
may not be necessarily counted as software,
depending on how we define software,
it is certainly true that file formats
and the specific software applications
that display or play them
are intertwined.
If you are old enough,
you may remember the
headaches caused with files created
as <strong>.doc</strong> in some early version
of Microsoft Word that later failed
to display properly in a
future Microsoft Word version or
in some other word document software
or on some other operating system.
WordPerfect 5.1 was a
popular word processing applications
in the 1990s, and
it's not clear if files
created with that application,
or other popular word processing
applications at that time,
would open today,
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/%7Eem36/wpdos/wptoword.html">at least without intervention</a>.
In short, these complexities
introduce obstacles
to the first sale doctrine and
raise other copyright issues
because of the
connection to software,
which is also often copyrighted.</p>
<p>The main idea here, though,
is that copyright holders and
publishers have
little financial interest in
selling actual digital
copies of works
since they cannot prevent
future distribution without
special technologies.
Instead, they are motivated
to license material,
and retain ownership, and
sometimes explicitly tie that material
to specific pieces of
software and hardware,
like the Kindle,
which would have to be bought.
That, we should note,
adds additional expense.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-ebook-collections"><a class="header" href="#impact-on-ebook-collections">Impact on Ebook Collections</a></h2>
<p>What does this mean for
libraries in the digital age?
It means that libraries buy less and
rent or license more, and
renting means that
they continually pay for
something for as long as they
want access to it.
As <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/5833">Sanchez (2015)</a> puts it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At its simplest, this takes the form of paying x dollars per year per title
during the length of the contract (Forecasting sect, para 4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the total supply of
works increases, e.g.,
the total number of published
books increase,
as they do each year,
then it means renting more and
more without ever
completely acquiring.
(It also means, holding collections
at a stable number,
providing access to less.)
When budgets are cut or
remain stagnant,
this ultimately entails
a decline in the collection a
library has to offer,
or if not a decline in the collection,
then cuts in some other areas of a library,
like the number of librarians
or other staff.
This is the conundrum
that Sanchez raises in his article.</p>
<p>If that alone were the issue,
maybe librarians could
discern other sustainable
ways to proceed, but
Sanchez (2015) raises additional
issues and questions:
what if publishers raise the
prices for digital content
at an annual rate faster than
what they already raise for
print content (reasonable assumption)?
If so, does that mean that
librarians will be able
to afford fewer titles,
digital or print,
unless they raise their budgets, and,
as they weed,
how would that impact the
physical space of the library?
(See figure 2.3, specifically,
from Sanchez's article.
The plot shows just how
much could be lost and
how little gained if
the forecasts Sanchez
discusses come true.)</p>
<p>There are many ways
to put constraints on the supply
of an item in the digital landscape,
as opposed to limiting supply
in the physical space,
which involve fewer methods.
That is, it's relatively easy for
publishers and others to
restrict the supply of physical works.
They simply have to limit how
many of those physical works are
manufactured
(e.g., the number of print runs).
But given the nature of digital content,
restricting supply is driven by
the technologies available to do so,
and since there are so many
publishers and distribution points,
then each one of these points will
often create their own unique type of
constraint on the supply.
The result is that there will
be a number of confusing methods
implemented to limit constraint,
even if these limitations
are marketed as selling points.
In practice,
this may mean that only a limited
number of people may &quot;check&quot;
out a work from a library at one time,
or access a database at one time, and
so forth.
Thus, the budget issue has
an impact on access and usability.</p>
<p>There have been recent attempts
to address these issues.
<a href="https://www.charleston-hub.com/2022/07/legally-speaking-states-unsuccessful-in-providing-financial-relief-of-ebook-terms-for-libraries/">Paganelli (2022)</a> describes
some state by state efforts to
lessen the financial burdens on libraries
that e-content entails.
However, as Paganelli notes,
these efforts have largely
not succeeded.
From a publisher's perspective,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12109-022-09880-7">Sisto (2022)</a>
argues that the general
narrative about the tension between
libraries and publishers is misleading.
Instead, the author argues,
the landscape is much more complex, and
the publishers have made a number
of attempts to &quot;make their e-lending
policies better for librarians&quot;
(2018-2019: Policy Updates and
Different Opinions sect, para 6).
Personally, I'm not sure I buy
(or lease) many of Sisto's arguments,
but I think one thing is clear:
the e-lending market is complex and
miscommunication abounds.</p>

<p>Although ebooks likely represent
the biggest impact on
public library budgets,
academic libraries are largely
concerned with scholarly journals.
Like Sanchez (2015),
<a href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/death-1000-cuts-periodicals-price-survey-2018">Bosch, Albee, &amp; Henderson (2018)</a>
show that the major issue
is that academic library
budgets are declining or
holding flat
even though prices continue to
increase for journal titles and
even though the number of
published articles increase.
This raises an interesting phenomenon:
although researchers are
hurt by the lack of access to research,
researchers are also part of the
cause of the supply.</p>
<p>The authors also note that
part of the drive to publish
includes a drive to publish in
so-called <em>prestigious</em> journal
titles, where <em>prestigious</em> is
determined by how well cited the
title is.
The authors refer to a
few citation-based metrics that
the research community uses to
determine prestige.
These include
the long-established <em>Impact Factor</em>,
which can be examined in
the <em>Journal Citation Reports</em>
(JCR) provided by Clarivate Analytics,
as well as newer ones,
such as the <em>Eigenfactor</em> and
the <em>Article Influence Score</em>,
which can also be examined in
JCR (the eigenfactor.org site is
not well updated, at the time of
this writing).</p>
<p>One motivation for using a
citation metric as the basis
of evaluating journal titles is
because citation metrics indicate,
at some level, the use of the work.
That is, a citation to
an article in a journal title
means, ideally, that the authors
citing that article have read the article
and use the knowledge from that work
to add new knowledge.
Historically, when Eugene
Garfield invented the <em>Impact Factor</em>,
it was partly so as a
tool for librarians to use in
collection management because he
recognized this use-based theory
of citations.</p>
<p>However, citation metrics should
never be the sole or even primary
tool to evaluate research, though.
While they may provide good
information, there are many caveats.
First, there are different
fields of research,
and some fields cite at different
rates and at different volumes
than other fields, and also for
different reasons.
This is why,
in Table 5 of the
Bosch, Albee, and Henderson (2018)
article, the cost per cite for journals
in the Philosophy &amp; Religion
category are so much higher that
the cost per cite of titles in
other categories.
Authors in P&amp;R simply have different
citation and publishing behaviors
than authors in other categories.
Second, citations do not capture
all uses of a journal.
For example, there are many journal
titles that I might use in my
courses but may not use in my research,
and this is true for other faculty,
yet citation metrics won't reflect
that kind of use.
The authors refer to <em>altmetrics</em>,
which was invented to help capture
additional non-citing uses of
scholarly products, but altmetrics
is still in its infancy and is
largely dependent on data sources
and scholarly behavior that are
problematic themselves.
Third, there are various issues with
the metrics themselves.
The <em>Impact Factor</em> is based on an
outdated calculation and is thus
not a very appropriate statistical
measure.
The other metrics 
were created to address that but
may have other problems.
And four, the use of the metrics,
regardless of which one, tends to
drive publishing behavior---such
that journal titles with higher
metrics tend to attract more
submissions and more attention,
thus driving more citations
to them.
Such skewing drives demand
to publish in those journals.
Thus, citation based metrics are
comparable to a kind
of capitalist economic system
where, as the sociologist of
science Robert Merton noted,
<a href="http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthew1.pdf">the richer get richer (in
citations) and the poor get
poorer</a>.
The issue then is that prestige,
defined in this way,
does not necessarily indicate quality:
just use.</p>
<p>The authors also discuss some
issues with <em>Gold Open Access</em> and
the idea that Gold OA may compound
the cost problem.
This is where authors
pay a publication fee,
or an article processing charge
(APC), once a manuscript has
been accepted by a
journal (there are other types of
Gold OA cost models).
We can do a quick off the cuff
and rough calculation to see why this
might compound the problem.
As an example,
<em>PLOS ONE</em> is one of the largest
gold OA journals
and charges an
<a href="https://www.plos.org/publication-fees">APC of $1,805 USD</a>
(that's $110 more than it was in 2021 and
$210 more than it was in 2020, when
I wrote the first draft of this section).
In 2018, 32 papers were published in
PLOS ONE that included at least
one author from the University
of Kentucky, totaling $51,040 in
APCs for the 50 total institutions
that were associated with these papers.
This amounts to about $1020
per institution, in 2018 dollars,
paid for by the authors and not
libraries.
For UK authors, this also amounts
to over $32,640 spent on APCs
(32 * $1020).
This is about $27K more than
the average price of the most expensive
category, Chemistry, as reported
in Table 1 of the reading.
So even if open access reduced
costs to libraries,
it still may not reduce cost
on taxpayers at large,
which are who fund much of
publishing much of this research.</p>
<p>The 2022 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/08/25/ostp-issues-guidance-to-make-federally-funded-research-freely-available-without-delay/">public access mandate</a>
issued by The White House
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/">Office of Science and Technology Policy</a>
might make things more <em>interesting</em>.
The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">OSTP memorandum</a> states that
&quot;federally funded research must be
publicly accessible without an embargo
on their free and public release.&quot;
This mandate requires that federal
agencies with research and development
expenditures to develop their own policies,
and that could mean that such policies
result in Gold OA agency-specific mandates
or Green OA mandates.
Green OA means allows pre-prints
be made available (article versions 
before peer-review) or
post-prints (article versions after
peer-review) but not publisher versions
(versions after formatting, etc.).
We'll see how this plays out.</p>
