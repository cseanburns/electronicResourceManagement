<p><strong>Access</strong> is the paramount principle of librarianship, and
all other issues,
from censorship to information retrieval or to usability,
within LIS,
are on some level derived from or framed
by that principle of <strong>Access</strong>.</p>
<p>This week we devote ourselves
to a discussion of <strong>electronic access</strong>, and
it is helpful to begin with Samples and Healy (2014),
who provide a nice framework for thinking about
managing electronic access.
They include two broad categories,
<em>proactive troubleshooting</em> and
<em>reactive troubleshooting</em> of access.</p>
<ul>
<li>proactive troubleshooting of access: &quot;defined as
troubleshooting access problems before they are identified
by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;letting public-facing library staff know about
planned database downtime&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;doing a complete inventory to make sure that every
database paid for is in fact 'turned on'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reactive troubleshoot of access: &quot;defined as
troubleshooting access issues as problems are identified
and reported by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;fixing broken links&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;fixing incorrect coverage date ranges in the catalog&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;patron education about accessing full text&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal here, as suggested by Samples and Healy (2014),
is to maximize proactive troubleshooting and
to minimize reactive troubleshooting.
Or, to prevent problems from happening.
The Samples and Healy (2014) report is a great example
of why we call the field <em>library science</em>.
The purpose of making librarianship a science
was based on a need to rigorize librarianship,
to systematically study the problems of libraries, and
to generalize solutions based on systematic study.
The project they describe does that nicely.
The authors identified a problem that
had grown &quot;organically,&quot;
collected and analyzed data, and
then generalized from it by outlining
a &quot;detailed workflow&quot; to &quot;improve the timeliness and
accuracy of electronic resource work.&quot;
Practically, studies like this promise to improve
productivity and better work flows that foster job and
patron satisfaction.
It could also help librarians identify the kinds of
software solutions that will align with their workflows and patron information
behaviors. If interested, you might want to read a recent article in the
<em>Journal of Electronic Resource Librarianship</em> about the impact of Covid-19 on
electronic resource management. Six authors individually describe access issues
at their respective institutions and show how issues of pricing, acquisitions,
training, user expectations, and budgets affect electronic access. It is good
to read articles like this in light of the framework provided by Samples and
Healy (2014) because stories like these, about this impact of the pandemic on
electronic access, could help guide us in developing proactive troubleshooting
procedures that will minimize issues in the future, pandemic or not, at our own
institutions.</p>
<p>Lowe, R. A., Chirombo, F., Coogan, J. F., Dodd, A., Hutchinson, C., &amp; Nagata,
J. (2021). Electronic Resources Management in the Time of COVID-19: Challenges
and Opportunities Experienced by Six Academic Libraries. <em>Journal of Electronic
Resources Librarianship, 33</em>(3), 215–223.

<p>Back to Samples and Healy (2014), who say something important against a common
assumption about electronic resources, particularly those provided by vendors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impression that once a resource is acquired, it is then just 'accessible'
belies the actual, shifting nature of electronic resources, where continual
changes in URLs, domain names, or incompatible metadata causes articles and
ebooks to be available one day, but not the next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, unlike a printed work from the long ago print-only era that, once
cataloged, may be shelved for decades or longer without major problems of
access, electronic resources require constant and active attention to maintain
accessibility to them. Ebooks, for example, can create metadata problems. Often
what's important about scholarly ebooks, in particular, are the chapters they
include, and hence metadata describing ebook components is important, along
with providing links to those chapters in discovery systems. This difference
between item-level cataloging and title-level cataloging, as Samples and Healy
describe, can lead to confusing and problematic results when considering
different genres and what those genres contain. Or, note that they discuss how
a series of links are involved starting from the source of discovery, e.g., an
OPAC, to the retrieved item, and how difficult it might be in determining which
of these links and which of those services is broken when access becomes
problematic.</p>
<p>Let me highlight a few key findings from their report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflows: why does this keep coming up? It's because workflows help automate
a process---simplify and smooth out what needs to be done, and because this
is only possible when things are standardized.</li>
<li>Staffing: we'll discuss this more in a future forum, but part of the problem
here is that ERM has had a major impact on organizational structure, but one
where different libraries have responded differently. This lack of
organizational standardization has its benefits regarding overall management
practices and cultures, but it also has huge drawbacks---and that's the
difficulty in establishing effective, generalized workflows that include key
participants, and to minimize as many dependencies on any one person.</li>
<li>Tracking: if there's no tracking, there's no method to systematically
identify patterns in problems. And if that's not possible, then there's no
method to solve those problems proactively. It's just all reactive, and
reactive troubleshooting, as Samples and Healy indicate, results in poor
patron experiences. We'll discuss tracking when we during the week on
Evaluation and Statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the Carter and Traill (2017) article because we commonly get the line
that discovery systems are a great solution to all the disparate discipline
based resources that librarians subscribe to in order to search their
collections. Or, if we do think about problems with such systems, we are often
presented with a basic information retrieval problem, such that the larger the
collection to search, the more likely a relevant item will get lost in the mix.
But as Carter and Traill (2017) point out, these discovery systems also tend to
reveal access problems as they are used. The authors provide a checklist, as a
result of their analysis, to track issues and improve existing workflows.</p>
<p>The Buhler and Cataldo (2016) article provides an important reminder that the
mission of the electronic resource librarian is to serve the patron. This
should remind us that the internet and the web have flattened genres, and have
made it difficult to distinguish among things like magazine articles, news
articles, journal articles, encyclopedia articles, ebooks, etc. Though the
Buhler and Cataldo (2016) reading is student-focused, other studies have hinted
at the same issue they describe across other populations. It's important, if
possible, to recognize these issues as ERM librarians and work to resolve them
in the ways that you would be able to.</p>
<p>I grew up with some understanding of the differences between an encyclopedia
article, a journal article, a magazine article, a newspaper article, a chapter
in a book, a handbook, an index, a dictionary, etc. because I grew up with the
printed versions and because these were tangible things that looked different.
Today, a traditional first year college student was born around the year 2003
and grew up reading around the turn of the first decade. The problem this
raises is that although electronic resources are electronic or digital, they
are still based on genres that originated in the print age, yet they lack the
physical characteristics that help distinguish one from the other. E.g., what's
the difference between a longer <em>NY Times</em> article (traditionally a newspaper
article) and an article in the <em>New Yorker</em> (traditionally a magazine article)
today? Aside from some aesthetic differences between the two, they are both web
pages, and it's not altogether obvious, based on any kind of cursory
examination, that we can tell, as regular users, that they're entirely
different genres. However, there are important informational differences
between the two, how they were written, how they were edited, who they were
written by that might still lead us to consider them as different genres. Even
<em>Wikipedia</em> articles pose this problem. Citing an encyclopedia article was
never an accepted practice, but this was only true for general encyclopedias.
It was generally okay to cite articles from special encyclopedias because they
focused on limited subject matters like specific areas of art, music, science,
culture, and were usually more in-depth in their coverage. Examples include the
<em>Encyclopedia of GIS</em>, the <em>Encyclopedia of Evolution</em>, <em>The Kentucky African
American Encyclopedia</em>, <em>The Encyclopedia of Virtual Art Carving
Toraja--Indonesia</em>, and so forth. There are some studies that show that
<em>Wikipedia</em> does provide that kind of in-depth coverage of some subject
matters, thus helping to flatten the encyclopedia genre, too.</p>
<p>The flattening holds true for things like <em>Google</em>. The best print analogy for
<em>Google</em> is that of an index, which was used to locate keywords that would
point to source material. See the links in the discussion post for examples.
The main difference between these indexes and <em>Google</em> is that the indexes were
produced to cover specific publications, like a newspaper, or specific areas,
like the <em>Social Science Citation Index</em> or the <em>Science Citation Index</em>, both
of which are actual, documented, historical precursors to <em>Google</em> and to
<em>Google Scholar</em>. But, today, these search engines are erroneously considered
source material (e.g, &quot;I found it on Google&quot;). Few, I think, would have
considered a print index as source material, but rather as a <strong>reference</strong>
item, since it <em>referred</em> users to sources. Now it's all mixed up, but who can
blame anyone.</p>
<p>Let's discuss all of this on the board.</p>
