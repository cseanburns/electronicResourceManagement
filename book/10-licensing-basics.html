<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I think it's fair to say
that what characterizes
electronic resource management the most
is licensing.
For if something is licensed,
then it's most likely e-content or related,
and by definition, it's not owned by a library,
and thus it's a <em>temporary</em> item in the collection,
and thus requires special management.</p>
<p>Licensing requires understanding other
aspects of electronic resource management, too.
While an ERM librarian's job duties might
be solely focused on the technical aspects
of the work,
i.e., those things we covered in prior sections,
an ERM librarian whose primary job
duty is to participate in the
licensing process must have a good grasp
of the technical for no reason
other than that it is the technical
that is licensed.
In other words,
it's probably a good thing
to understand what is being licensed.
Thus, this is an area of ERM librarianship
that might take time to work up to.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though,
we should refresh ourselves
on the basics of copyright law,
since what is being licensed is a
fact of its existence.
We should also know something about
contract law, and
how the two types of laws are related,
since licensing entails negotiating,
signing, and managing contracts.</p>
<h2 id="copyright-and-contracts"><a class="header" href="#copyright-and-contracts">Copyright and Contracts</a></h2>
<p>There is a complicated tension 
between <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/">copyright law</a> and
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contract">contract law</a>.
In short, copyright is
a temporary <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/"><em>right</em></a> because
of its close connection to the concept
of the <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/">public domain</a>.
In the US, copyright was established in
the Constitution under
<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C8-1/ALDE_00013060/">Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8</a>,
which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The Congress shall have Power ...] To
promote the Progress of Science and useful
Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors
and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
respective Writings and Discoveries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reading of this has been,
and note, this is my reading and
not necessarily legal dogma,
that <em>respective Writings and Discoveries</em>
belong to the public;
as such, this clause was articulated
in the Constitution
to carve out some protection space
for the authors or inventors
from the public,
for <em>a limited time</em>,
in order to <em>promote
the Progress of Science and useful Arts</em>.
But in the end,
it is the public that is served
and that ultimately owns these creations.</p>
<p>The clause gives copyright owners
a <em>right</em>, and as a right,
it takes preemptive status
over other laws that are
less universal,
laws that are <em>in personam</em> (Rub, 2017).
On the other hand,
what creates tension is that
it is a kind of <em>right</em> that can
be transferred or sold by way of a contract;
that is, it is <em>in personam</em>.
Under this view,
copyrighted work is property (Rub, 2017),
and as property,
it can be traded for goods
and services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>in personam</em>: made against or affecting
a specific person only;
imposing a personal liability (Google Dictionary).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, copyright exists in a unique space
where it functions as a basic right,
embedded in the earliest part of the
US Constitution;
it exists as a temporary bulwark
against public ownership for
the public good;
and unlike other, basic rights,
copyright is transferable,
much like property is transferable.</p>
<p>This all gets more complicated when
licensing enters the picture, and
this largely has to do with three things.
First, the history of software
reflects the history of print,
in as much as source code relied
on a physical medium,
like a floppy disk or magnetic tape,
to be distributed,
just as a book had to be printed
to be distributed.
Second, the internet and greater
availability of higher bandwidth speeds
enabled, like books, software to
be distributed as easily as any
other digital object.
Third, it wasn't originally
clear that software, or source code
in particular, was copyrightable,
but the Copyright Office at the
Library of Congress eventually
decided that it was eligible.
This elibility became codified
in an 1980 amendment to
the 1976 Copyright Act.
This cemented the ability for 
software copyright owners to lease
their source code,
especially once that code was
free of a physical expression,
and thereby evade the First Sale Doctrine,
to users without transferring ownership
of the expression to users.</p>

<h2 id="licensing-agreements"><a class="header" href="#licensing-agreements">Licensing Agreements</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.esports.law/blog/licensing-agreements-components-and-concerns">Licensing agreements</a>
offer copyright or intellectual property
(patents, trademarks)
owners a contractual framework.
This framework functions as an
agreement among two or more parties.
It enables the parties involved
to participate,
within some range of time
(all contracts must have
start and end dates),
in an owner's intellectual property
under certain conditions.
Librarians enter into licensing
agreements of all sorts.
Licences cover bibliographic databases,
ILS/ERM software, and
of course, e-content.</p>
<p>Entering a licensing agreement for
e-content means that libraries
do not own that content but
only have access for a limited period of time,
as defined in the contract.
This is unlike print works,
which fall under the first-sale doctrine.
The existence of a licensing agreement
between a library and an
intellectual property owner
thus entails lack of
ownership of the <em>item</em>
(think of item as defined by the
<em>Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records</em>
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/cds/downloads/FRBR.PDF">FRBR</a> model).</p>
<h2 id="licenses"><a class="header" href="#licenses">Licenses</a></h2>
<p>Weir (2016) provides a nice outline
of licenses and what they include.
According to Weir,
there are two general types
of licensing agreements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End user agreements</strong>: these are generally the kind that people
accept when they use some kind of software or some service.</li>
<li><strong>Site agreements</strong>: these are the agreements librarians get involved
in when they negotiate for things like databases. Here, <em>site</em> refers
to the organizational entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Licenses must include a variety of components.
Weir (2016) outlines the parts
of a standard license.
They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introductions</strong>: this includes information about the licensee and
the licensor, date information, some information about payments and
the schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong>: this section defines the major terms of the contract.
Weir includes, as examples, the licensee, the licensor, authorized
user, user population, and whether the contract entails a single or
multi-user site.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong>: This covers topics such as IP authentication and proxy
access.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable use</strong>: Included here are issues related to downloading,
storage, print rights, interlibrary loan (ILL), and preservation.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited use</strong>: What people cannot do: download restrictions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: What the licensee's (the library)
responsibilities are. Be careful about accepting responsibility for
actions that the library would have a difficult time monitoring. Then
also, what are the licensor's responsibilities. This might include
topics such as 24 hour access.</li>
<li><strong>Term and terminations</strong>: Details about the terms of the contract and
how the contract may be terminated. Be aware that many libraries are
attached to either municipal, county, or state governments and must
adhere to relevant laws.</li>
<li>Various provisions</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example,
the California Digital Library,
via the University of California,
provides a <a href="https://cdlib.org/resources/vendors/license-agreement-checklist/">checklist</a>
and a copy of their
standard license agreement.</p>
<p>The checklist covers four
main sections, additional subsections,
and is well worth a read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content and Access</li>
<li>Licensing</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Management</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="standardizing-agreements"><a class="header" href="#standardizing-agreements">Standardizing Agreements</a></h2>
<p>Like the various technologies that
we have covered,
NISO and its members moved toward
forming a document that helps
create a common license framework.
The result was
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/seru">SERU: A Shared Electronic Resource Understanding</a>.
Although all licenses share some
basic similarities,
as discussed in Weir (2016) above,
the details of the hundreds of licenses
a large library has to handle
can get lost in a sea of variability.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/RP-7-2012_SERU.pdf">SERU is a NISO recommended practice</a>
helps to resolve this.
It fosters a common approach
to some aspects of the licensing process and
in fact can be used as
&quot;an alternative to a license agreement&quot;
if a provider and a library agrees to use it.
Like the standard licensing structure
that Weir (2016) outlines,
SERU includes parts that
describe use, inappropriate use,
access, and more
but also posits other stipulations,
such as
confidentiality and privacy.</p>
<h2 id="nasig-core-competencies"><a class="header" href="#nasig-core-competencies">NASIG Core Competencies</a></h2>
<p>We have addressed the
<a href="https://www.nasig.org/Core-Competencies">NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians (NCC)</a>
in earlier sections.
The NCC is a reminder 
of the centrality of licensing
for the ERM librarian.
Section 1.2 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thorough knowledge of electronic resource licensing and the legal
framework in which it takes place.  Since licenses govern the use of
most library electronic resources and have conditions that cannot
knowingly  be  violated,  an ERL with responsibilities related to
licensing must demonstrate familiarity with how and for whom an
organization licenses content, as well as the concepts, implications,
and contract language pertaining to such issues as archival rights,
perpetual access and interlibrary loan.  A practical working
understanding of issues such as copyright and fair use will allow ERLs
to obtain the least restrictive, most library-friendly licensing terms
during publisher/vendor license negotiations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though I have covered NCC
in earlier sections,
it's a reminder that when
we talk about electronic resource management,
we talk about a comprehensive
list of responsibilities,
skills, technologies, and more, and
that we should keep this on our radar.
Second, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2015.1026225">Regan (2015)</a>
specifically mentions these competencies
with respect to the importance of
learning more about the licensing process.</p>
<p>I think it's still true,
seven years after publication and
as Regan (2015) states,
that few library schools cover licensing
and license negotiations and
more broadly,
electronic resource management, but
I think that's changing.
Even if it's covered, like here,
Regan's advice is still important and
the essential questions they ask
are relevant even if you have
extensive experience with the process.</p>
<p>What is also relevant is the
additional theme that Regan (2015)
covers about the importance
of advocating.
Many people are nervous about the
idea of having to negotiate a license
for an e-product, but
in reality,
such work is not done outside of a team.
And that team will likely include
people who work outside of libraries.
This makes it important to advocate
for the library and the licensing process.</p>
<h2 id="liblicense"><a class="header" href="#liblicense">LIBLICENSE</a></h2>

to the main template, but
also links to additional model licenses
that cover the United States,
the United Kingdom, and Canada
from various institutional perspectives,
including consortial licensing.</p>
<p>The LIBLICENSE model license
includes helpful details,
such as types of authorized uses and
provisions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>course reserves</li>
<li>course packs</li>
<li>electronic links</li>
<li>scholarly sharing</li>
<li>scholarly citation</li>
<li>text and data mining</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that anything
that is covered in a license is subject
to negotiation between the library and
the vendor.
That does not meant that terms will
be accepted between the parties, but
if something is unfavorable or not
in the best interests of your institution
and patrons,
then that needs to be discussed by all parties.</p>
<p>These model licenses are invaluable
not only from a practicing perspective but
also from an educational perspective.
The more you review,
the more comfortable you will become
working with them.
And, as we will learn in the next section,
one of the most important parts of the
negotiating process is being prepared
to negotiate.
That entails being familiar with the
basic license model.</p>
