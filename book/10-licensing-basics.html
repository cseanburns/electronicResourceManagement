<p>This week we start two week's of discussion on licensing. Licensing is at the
top of the list of most important aspects of electronic resource management. We
start our coverage now because it was necessary to learn about the technical
and the economic aspects of ERM work as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>First, we should not that there is a hierarchical difference between <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/">copyright
law</a> and contract law. In short, although copyright is a kind of
<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/">temporary <em>right</em></a> (ante public domain status), unlike other
types of rights (e.g., legal or civil rights), it is a <em>right</em> that can be
transferred or sold by way of a contract. Contract law, thus, supersedes
copyright law.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.esports.law/blog/licensing-agreements-components-and-concerns">licensing agreements</a> offer copyright or
intellectual property owners a contractual framework. This framework functions
as a contractual agreement among two or more parties, and it enables the
parties involved to participate, within some range of time (all contracts must
have starting and ending dates), in an owner's intellectual property under
certain conditions. Librarians enter into licensing agreements of all kinds.
The types of things that are licensed include bibliographic databases, ILS/ERM
software, and of course, e-content. Unfortunately, regarding the latter,
entering a licensing agreement for e-content means that libraries do not own
that content but only have access for a period of time, as defined in the
contract. This is unlike print works, which fall under the first-sale doctrine.
That is, once a library ones, for example, a physical book, it owns it for as
long as they want to or can own it. Basically, the existence of a licensing
agreement between a library and an intellectual property owner entails lack of
ownership of the <em>item</em> (think of item as defined by the <em>Functional
Requirements for Bibliographic Records</em> <a href="https://www.loc.gov/cds/downloads/FRBR.PDF">FRBR</a> model).</p>
<p>The readings are pretty straightforward, but let's preview some basics, which
are nicely outlined in Weir (2016) (not in the reading but referenced below):</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two general types of licensing agreements:
<ul>
<li><strong>End user agreements</strong> are generally the kind that people accept when
they use some kind of software or some service.</li>
<li><strong>Site agreements</strong> are the kinds of agreements librarians get involved
in when they negotiate for things like databases. Here, <em>site</em> refers to
the organizational entity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are several important parts of a standard license. They include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Introductions</strong>: this includes information about the licensee and the
licensor, date information, some information about payments and the
schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong>: this section defines the major terms of the contract.
Weir includes, as examples, the licensee, the licensor, authorized user,
user population, and whether the contract entails a single or multi-user
site.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong>: This covers topics such as IP authentication and proxy
access.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable use</strong>: Included here are issues related to downloading,
storage, print rights, interlibrary loan (ILL), and preservation.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited use</strong>: What cannot people do: download restrictions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: What the licensee's (the library) responsibilities.
Be careful about accepting responsibility for actions that the library
would have a difficult time monitoring. Then also, what are the
licensor's responsibilities. This might include topics such as 24 hour
access.</li>
<li><strong>Term and terminations</strong>: Details about the terms of the contract and
how the contract may be terminated. Be aware that many libraries are
attached to either municipal, county, or state governments and must
adhere to relevant laws.</li>
<li>Various provisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, the California Digital Library, via the University of
California, provides a <a href="https://cdlib.org/resources/vendors/license-agreement-checklist/">checklist</a> and a copy of their standard
license agreement.</p>
<p>The checklist covers four main sections and is well worth a read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content and Access</li>
<li>Licensing</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Management</li>
</ul>
<p>We have three additional readings this week. One of the readings covers SERU: A
Shared Electronic Resource Understanding, by NISO. We also have a short article
by Regan that provides some guidelines on becoming competent on licensing.</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/8593/RP-7-2012_SERU.pdf">SERU</a>, <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/seru">Shared Electronic Resource Understanding</a>, is a NISO
collaborative document that helped standardize some aspects of the licensing
process and can be used as &quot;an alternative to a license agreement&quot; if a
provider and a library agrees to use it. Like the standard licensing structure
that Weir (2016) outlines, SERU includes parts that describe use, inappropriate
use, access, and more but also posits other stipulations, such as
confidentiality and privacy.</p>
<p>The other reading is the <a href="https://www.nasig.org/Core-Competencies">NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources
Librarians</a>. We have already visited this, and although it doesn't
specifically cover licensing, I added it to this week's reading list for a
couple of reasons. First, it's a reminder that when we talk about electronic
resource management, we talk about a comprehensive list of responsibilities,
skills, technologies, and more, and I need to keep this on our radar. Second,
because the Regan reading specifically mentions these competencies, and I
thought it would good to reintroduce them here.</p>
<p>This week, after reading the material, I want you to focus on the Regan article
and some of the questions raised there. Regan raises important questions about
the licensing process, about effective communication, and about advocacy. I
want you to comment on these issues, and I want you to answer some questions
that Regan raises. You can do that by searching the web and library websites.
In fact, at the beginning of the semester I asked you to subscribe to the
SERIALST email list. It's now time to draw upon that and any discussions you've
seen in those lists that are related. You can usually search the archives of
those lists, especially since traffic has been a bit light recently. Regan
mentions some other sources, such as <a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/">LIBLICENSE</a> and
<a href="https://www.copyrightlaws.com/">copyrightlaws.com</a>. Any of these are fair game for our discussions,
but the latter is a commercial entity that provides material and tutorials for
a kind of tuition. It might be useful to know about it, but explore only if you
want. However, LIBLICENSE provides model licenses as well as links to
<a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/licensing-information/model-license/">additional model licences</a>, including the above mentioned
California Digital Library Standard License Agreement. The LIBLICENSE model
license includes even more details, such as types of authorized uses, and
details that include provisions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>course reserves</li>
<li>course packs</li>
<li>electronic links</li>
<li>scholarly sharing</li>
<li>scholarly citation</li>
<li>text and data mining</li>
</ul>
