<p>Awhile ago now, I conducted some historical research on a librarian named Ralph
Parker. Inspired by technological advances in automation, specifically the use
of the punched cards and machines, Parker began to apply this technology to
library circulation processes in the 1930s and thus became the first person to
automate part of the library's work flow. By the mid-1960s, Parker's decades
long pursuit of library automation led to some major advances, including the
founding of <a href="https://www.oclc.org/">OCLC</a>. Meanwhile, the punched card system he continued to
develop eventually led to massive increases in circulation and better service
to patrons. In the mid-60s he wrote the following about the installation and
launch of a new punched card system to help automate circulation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the delight of the patrons it requires only four seconds to check out
materials (as cited in Burns, 2014).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think about that quote often. When I read that in his annual report in the
archives at the University of Missouri, I could feel his giddiness with these
results. Until this achievement, when a patron borrowed an item from the
library, the process involved completing multiple forms in order to be sure
that accurate records were kept. Accurate record keeping is important.
Libraries need to protect their collections but also provide access to them. As
stated in the <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027387052">Circulation work in public libraries / Jennie M. Flexner
(1927)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is necessary that the library have control of these circulating books in
several ways. It [the library] must know where they are, it must lay down
rules to see that thoughtless people do not retain the books in their
possession unfairly, and it must provide means for securing their prompt
return. These and many other considerations combine to make it necessary for
the [ circulation ] department to install and maintain very efficient methods
to control the circulation of books, which are commonly known as routines (p.
6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What were those routines in the 1930s and thenabouts? Why was Parker so excited
about his system taking only four seconds to check out a work? Well, two
routines are important for circulation. The first involves membership and the
second involves charging or checking out works.</p>
<p>Membership: First, if the patron was not yet a member of a library, then they
had to register to become one; hence, the first routine was to check their
membership and register them as borrowers if they were not yet a member or if
their membership had expired. If this was a public library, then the process
might vary a bit depending if the member was an adult or a youth (or
<em>juveniles</em> in the lingo of the time). Regardless, this routine basically
involved completing an application card, creating a member record and filing
that away for the library's use, and then giving the borrower a card of their
own, i.e., their <strong>borrower's card</strong>.</p>
<p>Charging: Once membership status was confirmed or created, then the circulation
librarian employed a system to <strong>charge</strong> books to the borrower. Several
systems had been employed up through the late 1920s, including the <strong>ledger
system</strong>, the <strong>dummy system</strong>, the <strong>temporary slip system</strong>, the <strong>permanent
slip or card system</strong>, the <strong>Browne system</strong>, and eventually the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Newark%20charging%20system">Newark
charging system</a> (see <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027387052">Flexner, p. 73 and on for
details</a>). Assuming the librarian in the 1930s used the Newark
system, when a book was to be checked out, the librarian needed to enter the
details on a &quot;book card, a date slip and a book pocket for each book&quot; (Flexner,
1927, p. 78). Flexner goes on to outline the process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date slip is pasted opposite the pocket at the back of the book. The date
which indicates when the book is due to be returned or when issued is stamped
on each of three records, the reader's card, the book card and the date slip.
The borrower's number is copied opposite the date on the book card. The date
on the date slip indicates at once the file in which the book card is to be
found, and the [librarian] assistant is able to discharge the book and
release the borrower immediately on the return of the volume (Flexner, 1927,
pp. 78-79).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, circulating books or works to patrons involved a lot of paperwork,
and you can imagine that it might be prone to error. However, the number of
systems at the time show that the processes and routines were increasingly
becoming standardized, and standardization is a necessary pre-requisite to
automation.</p>
<p>Parker's achievement in automation eventually improved the library experience
for patrons as well as the librarians at the circulation desk, and indirectly
their colleagues throughout the library. That is, once circulation standards
stabilized, and once technology like punched cards became available generally,
then it became possible to automate this process for the library. And this was
good; the effects were that automation increased circulation and that an
automated circulation process <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._R._Ranganathan">saved the time of the reader</a>, four
seconds to be exact!</p>
<p>This is all to say that standards and technology go hand and hand and that the
details matter when thinking about standards. How does this relationship work?
Standards enable multiple groups of competing interests to form consensus
around how technology should work, and when this happens, multiple parties
receive payoffs at the expense of any single party acquiring a monopoly. This
is true for the design of screwdrivers, the width of railroad tracks, the
temperature scale, and certainly also to how information is managed and
exchanged. The internet and the web wouldn't exist or definitely not exist as
we know it if not for the standardization of the Internet Protocol (IP), the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
and other internet and web related technologies that enable the internet and
the web to work for so many users regardless of the operating system and the
hardware they use.</p>
<p>Our first article this week is written by Pat Harris and covers the basic
reasons for the existence of <a href="http://www.niso.org/">NISO</a> (the <em>National Information Standards
Organization</em>) and the kinds of standards NISO is responsible for maintaining
and creating. These standards are directly related to libraries and fall under
<a href="https://www.niso.org/welcome-to-niso">three broad categories</a> related to <strong>Information Creation &amp;
Curation</strong>, <strong>Information Discovery &amp; Interchange</strong>, and <strong>Information
Policy &amp; Analysis</strong>. There are standards that touch on bibliographic
information, indexing, abstracting, controlled vocabularies, and many other
library important issues. If you have not before paid attention to NISO, you
might now start seeing more references to the organization and the standards it
publishes, especially because the international library community has worked
closely with NISO to develop standards for various aspects of library work.</p>
<p>Another historical note: As Harris elaborates in the article, NISO came into
existence in the mid-1930s. This was about the same time that Ralph Parker
began working on his punched card system. Not long before this, in the late
1920s, the first library science graduate program launched at the University of
Chicago, and in the early 1930s, the first research based journal started, <em>The
Library Quarterly</em>. We often hear how long libraries have existed, and it's
true that there were quite a few accomplishments before the 1930s, but it is
this time period (for these and a number of other reasons) that marks the
modern era of libraries.</p>
<p>We also are not simply interested in standardizing things like the forms used
to catalog and charge a book, to create member records, to draw up a license
for an electronic resource, as we'll discuss later in the semester. We are also
interested in standardizing, as Flexner would say, &quot;routines&quot;, processes, or
workflows. Thus, our additional readings are on TERMS, or Techniques for
Electronic Resource Management. TERMS is not a true standard, but more of a <em>de
facto</em> standard that helps outline the electronic resource management work
flow. It was developed in order for librarians or others dealing with
electronic resources to come to a consensus on the processes of electronic
resource management. Version 1 of TERMS is described by the TERMS authors in
the <em>Library Technology Reports</em> readings of chapters 1-8. Although it has been
replaced by a <a href="http://6terms.tumblr.com/">newer version</a>, it still functions as a thorough
introduction to the ERM work flow and provides guidance and suggestions on all
aspects of electronic resource management. For example, in <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4738/5647">chapter
7</a> of the LTS report on TERMS version 1, the authors provide very
helpful information on the importance of working with providers or vendors in
case of cancellation of a resource. They write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not burn any bridges! Many resources have postcancellation access, which
means you need to keep up a working relationship with suppliers; this might
also incur a platform access fee going forward, so this needs to be budgeted
for in future years. Review the license to fully understand what your
postcancellation rights to access may be. In addition, you may resubscribe to
the resources in future years. Content is bought and sold by publishers and
vendors. Therefore, you may end up back with your original vendor a year or
two down the line!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of this material is repeated in version 2 of TERMS, but version 2 was
created in order to address changes in the world and to include more input from
the community. Version 2 also includes a slightly modified outline, and
<a href="https://library2.hud.ac.uk/blogs/terms/announcing-terms-ver2-0/terms-ver2-0-introduction/">includes the following parts</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Investigating new content for purchase or addition</li>
<li>Acquiring new content</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Ongoing evaluation and access, and annual review</li>
<li>Cancellation and replacement review</li>
<li>Preservation</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same link just provided, they also write about this new version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the works mentioned or cited in the original TERMS report,
much has been written in the past few years that can help the overwhelmed or
incoming electronic resources librarian manage their daily workflow. In the
end, however, most of the challenges facing the management of electronic
resources is directly related to workflow management. How we manage these
challenging or complex resources is more important than what we do, because
how we do it informs how successful and how meaningful the work is, and how
well it completes our goal of getting access to patrons who want to use these
resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, the outline and the content described in these two versions of TERMS
is very much centered on the ERM work flow. TERMS is essentially a guide and
framework for thinking on the different aspects of the electronic resource
life-cycle within the library, and helps provide librarians with a set of
questions and points of investigation. For example, let's consider Term item 1,
which is to investigate new content for purchase or addition. In a presentation
by the <a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/19420/">Emery and Stone (2014)</a>, they suggest that this involves the
following steps, partly paraphrased:</p>
<ul>
<li>outline what you want to achieve</li>
<li>create a specification document</li>
<li>assemble the right team</li>
<li>review the market and literature and set up trial</li>
<li>speak with suppliers and vendors</li>
<li>make a decision (Emery and Stone, slide 12, 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>Emery and Stone provide other examples, and the TERMS listed in this slide are
from the first version. TERM 6, PRESERVATION, was added in version 2, and TERMS
4 and 5 from version 1 were joined together. There is a link to these
<a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/19420/">slides</a>, with further examples, in the transcript of this lecture, as
well as the citation.</p>
<p>This week you have a two part exercise:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you will visit the NISO website and search for documentation on a
standard, recommended practices, or technical reports and post about it. The
differences between these publications follows:</p>
<p><strong>Technical reports:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NISO Technical Reports provide useful information about a particular topic,
but do not make specific recommendations about practices to follow. They are
thus &quot;descriptive&quot; rather than &quot;prescriptive&quot; in nature. Proposed standards
that do not result in consensus may get published as technical reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommended Practices:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NISO Recommended Practices are &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;guidelines&quot; for methods,
materials, or practices in order to give guidance to the user. These
documents usually represent a leading edge, exceptional model, or proven
industry practice. All elements of Recommended Practices are discretionary
and may be used as stated or modified by the user to meet specific needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <strong>Published and Approved NISO Standards</strong> are the final, approved
definitions that have been achieved by a consensus of the community.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards">https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards</a></p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, after reading about TERMS, try to place these TERMS in additional
electronic resource management context. Please draw from your experience last
week using the ILS and ERM software, from the readings, your personal work
experience in a library, if you have that, or use your imagination.
Specifically, it would be interesting if you could pick out aspects of systems
like Coral and Folio that appear to facilitate standardized workflows.</p>
<p>I am requiring a lot of reading this week because these readings capture the
specifics of the ERM work flow, and understanding them will help you get
started and attain success in this position. The Rinck article is a good
interview with the authors of TERMS. Consider this optional reading, but its
still worthy of your time.</p>
