<p>Class, this week we discuss aspects of collection development and acquisitions,
which is a complex problem for electronic resources. To rehash, in the
print-only days, acquiring resources was a <em>more-than-it-is-now</em> linear
process. Librarians became aware of an item, sought reviews of the item,
possibly collected the item, described it, and then shelved it. And maybe,
depending on the type of the library, weeded it from the collection at some
point in the years to come during their regular course of collection
assessment.</p>
<p>There are additional vectors to be aware of with electronic resources. First,
libraries may or may not necessarily own digital works, but different
subscription services require different kinds of contracts, as we have learned.
Second, electronic resources (ebooks, journal articles, databases, etc.)
require different handling and disseminating processes due to technological and
licensing barriers. Martin et al. (2009) truly nail the issue in their article
where they write that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as we would like to think our primary concerns about collecting are
based on content, not format, e-resources have certainly challenged many
long-established notions of how we buy, collect, preserve, and provide access
to information (p. 217).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although a world where the format dictates so much makes an intriguing world,
it can be problematic and worrisome. We think that content should be king, but
we must ask, how does format either prevent or facilitate access? If you catch
the implicit gotcha there, you can see that we're building a thread between
acquisitions, collections development, and usability, which we'll learn more
about latter in the semester.</p>
<p>One thing about this week: in a collection development course, you would
unquestionably focus on content and on the work that is involved creating a
collection development policy (which I hope you do or spearhead if your library
does not have one). I'll briefly discuss this soon. Those things are relevant
to the acquisition and collection of e-resources. However, in a major way, one
of the things you should take away from this week's reading is how much the
management of electronic resources have impacted librarian work flows and how
that has shaped, or reshaped, library organizational hierarchy. I'll provide an
organizational chart for you to discuss, and we'll use it to discuss how
electronic resources have shaped the organizational structure of the library.</p>
<p>The Lamothe (2015) article is good in a different way. Lamothe finds that if
electronic e-reference sources are collected and perpetually updated, then they
get continually used. If it's a static e-resource (compare, e.g., to a resource
pushed out in PDF, although it could be in HTML), then usage declines. I hope
additional studies pursue this line of questioning because it raises questions
about the expectations that our patrons have about our content; perhaps
something about how <em>fresh</em> they expect that content should be, where such an
expectation may have existed in different shape in prior years. It also
suggests that a resource like Wikipedia has an advantage, since much of
Wikipedia is regularly updated, or the site in general appears broadly so since
many parts of it are continually updated.</p>
<p>The Open Educational Resources (OER) issue is a hot topic these days. Textbook
prices, as the article by England et al. (2017) notes, have skyrocketed in
recent decades. Some textbooks cost hundreds of dollars, and the problem
impacts both school and academic libraries. UK Libraries has a helpful page
about Open Educational Resources. I'll provide a link here in the transcript
and in the discussion prompt, and that page links to OER content for both types
of libraries, including <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/">oercommons.org</a>. Explore this information, and
discuss whether libraries ought to collect and acquire these resources  or
(e.g., by adding records to them in their online public access catalogs or
discovery systems), or should they not be involved at all? This seems like a
<em>duh</em> kind of question, but libraries, public or academic, have not
traditionally collected textbooks. Does this change the game for them as
educational institutions?</p>
<p>A quick note about the organizational charts. The chart that I created was
based on my readings of librarian departmental reports written during the late
1950s and early 1960s by librarians at UK. These reports are held at the
University of Kentucky's <a href="http://libraries.uky.edu/SC">Special Collections Research Center</a>, which
is fortunately in the building next to mine on campus. Organizational charts
have been around since the 1800s, but I am not sure when libraries started to
create and use them, and I didn't see one in my research on the history of UK
Libraries for this time period. Thus, I inferred the organizational structure
based on the detailed reports written by the various department heads in the
library at the time. When you compare my chart based on the past to the current
one provided by UK Libraries, I think you will be intrigued by how much more
complicated the current chart is today.</p>
<p>This complexity is very interesting. The growth in electronic resources,
associated technologies, and markets do not explain all of it: knowledge has
become more specialized, and library organizational structure will reflect
that; the student population has grown considerably since then, in size and
heterogeneity, and library structure will reflect that; and the theory and
praxis of library management has evolved throughout the decades, and library
structure will reflect that. Other issues are at play, and it is certainly true
that they are all interconnected, but I do think that technology and
e-resources accounts for a large portion of what we see here, and I'm looking
forward to reading what you have to say about this.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd be guilty of a serious wrongdoing if I did not discuss the
importance of having a collection development policy (CDP) and using that
policy to guide the collection, acquisition, and assessment of electronic
resources. I don't mean to overlap any discussions you may have had about this
if you've had a collection management course, I only want to emphasize the
importance of a CDP for e-resources. Unfortunately, not all libraries, even at
major institutions, create or use a CDP, and if you end up working at one, then
I'd highly encourage you to convince your colleagues of its importance. A CDP
should define a collection, and then include most if not all the following
topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>mission, vision, and values statement</li>
<li>purpose of CDP statement (scope may be included here)</li>
<li>selection criteria: this could be general but it could also include
subsections that focus on specific populations, genres, resource types, and
more</li>
<li>assessment and maintenance criteria</li>
<li>challenged materials criteria (esp important at public, K-12 libraries)</li>
<li>weeding and/or replacement criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Included in this transcript are links to two CDP policies, one from the
<a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/collections/policies/electronic-resources">University of Maryland</a> and one from the <a href="https://www.lexpublib.org/collection-development-policy">Lexington Public
Library</a>. The Maryland CDP is not their main one but is a sub-CDP
that focuses on electronic resources. The LPL policy is the main one for them,
and although it does not include a long discussion of electronic resources,
they are mentioned in the policy. Neither approach is wrong but are catered to
the specific libraries and their purposes, communities, and vision statements.
This week, I would like you to search on the web for more and to read through
ones you find for how they discuss electronic resources.</p>
