<p>This short book is based on a
series of lectures for my
course on electronic resource management.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-book"><a class="header" href="#about-this-book">About This Book</a></h2>
<p>This book is not a comprehensive work to Electronic Resource Management (ERM).
However, it is meant to introduce students to ERM work, and
should be read along with the readings linked to in each chapter.
The linked readings are updated annually.</p>
<p>This book will be a live document.
The content will be updated each year that
I teach my course on electronic resource management,
which is generally each fall semester.
Updates will address changes in the field and to
edit for clarity when I discover some aspect
of the book causes confusion or
does not provide enough information.</p>

<p>Many of my incoming students are unaware that there is a specific role in
libraries for electronic resource management, yet electronic resource
management (ERM) in libraries plays a vital albeit invisible role. ERM
librarians ensure the organized acquisition, access, and control of digital
resources, and this requires them to manage e-books, online journals,
databases, and other digital content. This work is increasingly complex,
especially as libraries continue adapt to and contribute to the shape of the
digital age.</p>
<p>While many are aware of the classic cataloger and reference librarian,
electronic resource management librarianship is a specialized field that
specifically focuses on the above challenges. These professionals employ a
blend of technical skills and understanding of information access to negotiate
licenses, oversee subscription renewals, troubleshoot access problems, and work
collaboratively with other library staff to integrate electronic resources into
the library system. This specialized work requires them to be generalists, too.
That is, they must be aware of and support those other library staff and the
library's mission to provide seamless access to information, adapting to the
evolving needs of the academic community and the wider public.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces students to the field of electronic resource
management. It begins with a section that discusses different perspectives of
electronic resource management. Section 1.2 covers the kinds of activities ERM
librarians engage in at their libraries. Section 1.3 argues that regardless of
ERM librarian's specific skills and duties, a key characteristic of the field,
given its need to work with continuously emerging technologies, is one of
<em>constant disruption</em>.</p>

<p>This semester we're learning about electronic resources
and about how to manage them.
Let's begin by outlining the kinds of things
that are electronic resources.
<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/940697515">Karin Wikoff</a> (2011) outlines the major categories,
and these include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>databases</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>A&amp;I databases</strong> (abstracting and indexing)</li>
<li><strong>bibliographic databases</strong> full text databases</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>specialized and hybrid databases</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>Ebook technology is rather complicated and
differentiated depending on the copyright status,
the file type (PDF, ePUB, TXT, etc.), and
the purpose or genre
(textbook, fiction or non-fiction, etc.).
In some cases, ebooks are software applications and
not just plain or marked up text.
They also vary by platform or
the application used to interact with the text,
each of which may offer different types of functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linking technologies allow users
to begin in one search system,
like a discovery service,
which extends that query to other systems
without requiring the user to
initiate searches in those other systems.
For example,
a user begins a search in a library's discovery system,
like UK Library's <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY%3AUKY&amp;lang=en">InfoKat</a>
(powered by Primo (<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/11856/">Breeding, 2006</a>)).
InfoKat identifies multiple articles there
related to the query,
even though those articles are all located in other
full text systems, like EBSCOHost, ProQuest, or JSTOR.</p>
<h2 id="framing"><a class="header" href="#framing">Framing</a></h2>
<p>The print only era of libraries
was difficult enough for many reasons, but
managing print and using print resources
was comparably a more linear process.
Electronic resources have raised the stakes.
That might be expected:
civilizations have had 500 years
to develop and solve print technology,
yet we have had only about three plus decades of
experience with digital technology.
We are a long way off from stability, and
many of the challenges and frustrations
ahead of us are not simply technical but
also social and legal.</p>
<p>As you may surmise from the outline at the top of this page,
electronic resources are a major part of any library,
whether academic, public, school, or special.
The need to manage them with
efficient work flows requires
attending to many parts of a big system.
This will be much of what we will discuss and
learn about, especially because
there is a lot of complexity in these systems and
these systems have had a major impact on librarianship itself.</p>
<h2 id="our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship"><a class="header" href="#our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship">Our Readings: The nature of ERM librarianship</a></h2>
<p>Our readings this week provide
introductions to electronic resource librarianship
and help frame this course.</p>
<h3 id="a-specialist-and-a-generalist"><a class="header" href="#a-specialist-and-a-generalist">A Specialist and A Generalist</a></h3>
<p>The first article by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07317131.2017.1385286">Stachokas</a> (2018)
surveys the history of this specialist/generalist librarian role.
Stachokas (2018) finds that
the electronic resource librarian has their feet
planted in technical services and collection development,
that this requires a holistic understanding of the 
electronic resource work flow,
of its embeddedness in the scholarly and library ecosystem, and
that this division is leading to different areas of specialization:
those who focus on
&quot;licensing, acquisitions, and collection development&quot; (p. 15),
and those who focus on
&quot;metadata, discovery, management of 
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/kbart/kbart-frequently-asked-questions">knowledge bases</a>, and
addressing technical problems&quot; (p. 15).
This rings true to me.
In my own observations,
I've noticed that job announcements have increasingly stressed
one of the above areas and not both.</p>
<h3 id="the-technical-communicator-as-the-bridge"><a class="header" href="#the-technical-communicator-as-the-bridge">The Technical Communicator as the &quot;Bridge&quot;</a></h3>
<p>In the second article,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2016.1164555">Hulseberg</a> (2016) uses
the field of <a href="https://www.stc.org/about-stc/defining-technical-communication/">technical communication (TC)</a>
to interpret the field of electronic resource librarianship.
Hulseberg (2016) takes the view that an
electronic resource librarian is, among other things,
a technical communicator.
This is much different from being
someone who helps patrons with their technical problems.
Rather, this is someone who completes advanced work in
documenting and reporting technical processes.</p>
<p>Hulseberg (2016) highlights four important themes about ERM:
the interesting themes to me are
<em>Theme one: Metaphors of &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;translator&quot;</em>, and
<em>Theme Two: Collaborating in a web of relationships</em>.
When I was an undergraduate,
I imagined the job that I wanted
would be one connected people from different silos
to each other and helping them communicate.
It turns out that,
under Hulseberg's (2016) view,
electronic resource librarianship does this work,
which is pretty cool.
However, the other themes are just as important, and
in particular, <strong>Theme Four</strong>, about jurisdiction,
highlights one of the major disruptive acts on librarianship
in the last thirty or forty years.</p>
<p>As an example,
consider that most people,
researchers and scholars included,
use non-library provided resources to locate information.
Additionally, more works, scholarly and non-scholarly,
are freely and publicly available on the web,
e.g., as <a href="https://sparcopen.org/open-access/">open access (OA)</a>.
This might mean that the library
<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10355/37582">is becoming disintermediated</a>
as a result of people using non-library services,
like Google or Google Scholar,
to retrieve freely available works on the web,
instead of at the library.
As a result, what becomes of the core jurisdiction of the librarian?
And of the electronic resource librarian, in particular?
In concrete terms: a recent paper (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-03-2018-0047">Klitzing, 2009</a>)
reported that researchers state they use
Google Scholar 83% of the time and
EBSCOhost 29% of the time to find relevant material.
That raises strategic and technical questions about today's role
of the librarian and library in the scholarly communication system.</p>
<h3 id="to-license-or-not-to-license"><a class="header" href="#to-license-or-not-to-license">To License or Not To License</a></h3>
<p>The third article, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2016.02.002">Zhu</a> (2016),
places a different theoretical lens
on what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.
Zhu (2016) posits that the licensing aspect of
electronic resource management significantly influences
ER librarianship identity.
One reason why Zhu's (2016) findings are insightful is
due to the fact that we often license electronic resources
rather than buy them.</p>
<p>The crux centers around copyright law, which
provides librarians
with an important legal justification
for lending works:
the <a href="https://search.copyright.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=copyright&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=%22first+sale+doctrine%22">First Sale Doctrine</a>.
Copyright law provides copyright owners with the
right to distribute their work, but
the First Sale Doctrine holds that if you buy a copy of a book,
then you have a right to lend or sell your copy.
This doctrine is fundamental to librarianship but
also raises problems since most digital works
(ebooks, etc)
are licensed and not bought by libraries.
Thus the First Sale Doctrine does not apply
to such works.
That ALA has a guide on this issue
(<a href="https://libguides.ala.org/copyright/firstsale">ALA, 2022</a>).</p>
<p>Stachokas (2018), Hulseberg (2016), and Zhu (2016)
present the historical and environmental forces
that have shaped the work of electronic resource librarians and
their professional identities, and
each of these authors discuss important themes
that function as evidence of these identities.
In our discussions this week,
we should focus on these themes and
how to make sense of them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Electronic resource librarianship is a
fascinating area of librarianship.
Because digital technologies have woven their way
into all parts of the modern library ecosystem,
and because these digital technologies bring with them
a slew of technical, legal, and social challenges,
electronic resource librarians have had,
as these technologies have developed,
to maintain a holistic view of this ecosystem just
as they have had to specialize in key areas that
require maintaining that holistic, interconnected view.</p>
<p>The course takes that holistic view and
divides it into four parts for study.
In the first part,
we study the nature of the work itself:
what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.</p>
<p>In the second part, we learn about the technologies
that an electronic resource librarian uses and
the conditions that shape these technologies.
We will learn about integrated library systems (ILS) and
how these systems conform (or not) to standards, and
how they foster or obstruct 
interoperability and access.</p>
<p>In the third part, we focus on processes and their contexts.
We will study the electronic resource librarian's workflow,
the economics and the markets of electronic resources,
what is involved in licensing these resources and
negotiating with vendors.</p>
<p>At the end, we focus on patrons and end users;
that is, those we serve. 
Because electronic resources are digital,
when we use them, we leave behind traces of that usage.
This means we will study how that usage is measured and
what those measurements can validly say.
Because usage leaves traces of personal information,
we will examine topics related to the
security of these resources and the privacy of those
who use them.
Electronic resources likewise means having to use websites
and other e-resource interfaces, and
hence we will study how electronic resource librarians
are involved in user experience and usability studies.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-questions"><a class="header" href="#discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</a></h2>
<p>As we start to address all of this,
I want us to consider two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we manage all of this electronic stuff? Not only
does it include complicated technology and has an impact
on our patrons, but it involves all different sorts of
librarians.</li>
<li>What exactly is an electronic resource librarian? I like
this basic question because, due to perhaps
representations in the media (movies, TV shows, books)
and the interactions we've had with librarians in our
lifetimes, we all have pretty well-defined, whether
accurate, images of what reference or cataloging
librarians are. But what about an electronic resource
librarian? This is something different, right? And it's
not likely to be a position that's ever really captured
and presented publicly.</li>

<p>Class, in this section, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame the readings</li>
<li>discuss the readings, and</li>
<li>list some questions to guide our discussion for the week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal in this section is
to understand how the job of
electronic resource management (ERM)
has changed throughout the years and
to develop some ideas about where it is headed.</p>
<h3 id="framing-1"><a class="header" href="#framing-1">Framing</a></h3>
<p>This week we read two articles
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2014.03.013">Hartnett, 2014</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lcats.2009.11.001">Murdock, 2010</a>)
that analyze electronic resource librarian job advertisements.
Additionally, the reading list includes
the NASIG core competencies
for electronic resource librarianship.
I suggest that you review the list of core competencies
before you read the articles.</p>
<p>These articles are of interest since
they capture a description of electronic resource librarianship
in earlier years.
There are many social, political, and economic conditions that
have stayed about the same since these articles were published,
and these conditions help fixate the work of the ERM librarian,
but constant changes in technologies and types of electronic resources
have meant that electronic resource librarians are
constantly adapting to new work flows.
Our Murdoch (2010) reading makes this point.</p>
<p>Though the technology differs,
the descriptions and duties of ER jobs are still
on the mark in many ways.
I posted links to job announcements
in the discussion forum to demonstrate this.
Most of those job announcements
were emailed to the <a href="https://www.nasig.org/SERIALST">SERIALST</a>
email list (please subscribe to it) and
are not current job openings, but
they were current within the last few years.</p>
<p>To follow up on more current advertisements for ER librarians,
I did a Google search on August 24, 2023 using the following query:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;electronic resource librarian&quot; job
</code></pre>
<p>Results are consistent with past qualifications listed in the links
mentioned above and
with the <a href="01-the-erm-librarian.html">last section's</a> discussions
on the nature of ERM librarianship.
I will withhold linking to these advertisements since I don't expect
the links to persist as the positions get filled.
But several sources outline the following requested qualifications, and
I think the <strong>themes</strong> from the prior section come through
in this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide &quot;consistent and reliable access to the Library's electronic resources
and establishing workflows that maintain discovery and use of all Library
collections&quot;</li>
<li>analyze &quot;feasibility of technical platforms&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;resource licensing and contracting&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;copyright compliance&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;vendor negotiations&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Acts as a bridge across multiple Library units&quot;</li>
<li>enhance &quot;access and use&quot;</li>
<li>design a &quot;system of access&quot;</li>
<li>analyze &quot;staff and user issues with discovery of resources&quot;</li>
<li>coordinate &quot;system administration responsibilities for integrated library

limited to usage statistics, user experience statistics, collection analysis
and overlap&quot;</li>
<li>monitor &quot;listservs for Alma and Primo VE&quot;</li>

<li>partner &quot;with the Acquisitions Librarian and staff on the ordering and payment
activity of electronic resources&quot;</li>
<li>establish and &quot;documents library procedures and best practices for the
acquisition, licensing, implementation, assessment, and budgeting of

<li>develop and implement &quot;submissions to a shared University institutional
repository&quot;</li>
<li>works &quot;under the supervision of the Associate Director for Technical Services&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>To stay current about the position overall and
about the specific duties involved,
I encourage you to bookmark and
stay abreast of relevant journals in the area.
In addition to the two publication titles used in this
section's readings
and to the SERIALST list I have asked you to subscribe to,
I recommend that you bookmark relevant journals, like the
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/wacq20/current">Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship</a>,
<a href="https://www.charleston-hub.com/media/atg/">Against the Grain</a>, and
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/werm20/current">Journal of Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries</a></p>
<h3 id="our-readings"><a class="header" href="#our-readings">Our Readings</a></h3>
<p>Now let's start with Murdock's (2010) overview of the
electronic resource librarian's position
in the first decade of this century, and
proceed to Harnett's (2014) work that describes the
electronic resource librarian's duties around ten years ago.
NASIG's core competencies were also published around ten years ago
and have only received minor revisions since then.
We conclude by considering the current job advertisements
listed above and elsewhere.
With these,
our goal in this section is to get a sense of the
electronic resource librarian's job duties and
available technologies
from the earlier part of this century to now;
to understand where it was, how it has evolved,
and where it might be headed.
Overall, you will get a sense of just how much
this position has changed in the intervening years,
what I refer to as <strong>constant disruption</strong> in the next section.</p>
<p>One of the useful aspects of Murdock's (2010) article
is in section 4.3,
which lists a 'timeline of commercial ERM developments and standards.'
These technologies and standards
continue today,
and have, via hindsight,
strongly shaped how electronic resources currently work.
This timeline includes what's now referred to
as the A-Z list of serials,
which started in 2000,
OpenURL linking technology from 2001,
the combining of both integrated library systems (ILS)
and electronic resource management systems (ERMS) in 2004,
federated searching from 2005,
SUSHI usage statistics protocol from 2006,
and SERU from 2007.
We will explore each of these topics in future sections.</p>
<p>Murdock's (2010) analysis shows that some duties
started to wane in the early years.
Website maintenance and deployment (see Fig 13),
for example,
completely dropped off the radar.
This was likely due to the development of
content management systems,
i.e., turnkey website solutions,
that are still in use today.
For example, I remember <a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>
and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>,
both content management systems that
can work as library websites,
taking off around 2007 to 2009,
around the time that Murdock shows this area of activity declining.</p>
<p>One of Murdock's (2010) conclusions is that
employers sought &quot;to hire those who are able to perform
traditional librarian duties, such as reference and
instructional service, in addition to e-resource specific
tasks&quot; (p. 37).
Based on what we see in job advertisements today,
this seems to be much less the case as
electronic resource librarians have become more specialized,
as the position has divided into two areas
(cf., technical services aspect and collection development aspect),
and as electronic resources have grown and become more
dominant in the intervening years.
ER librarians still liaison with their communities but
in different ways (i.e., not as reference librarians).</p>
<p>A big change since 2012,
when Harnett's (2014) research ends,
is that more technology has moved to the cloud.
What this means is that we rely less on onsite servers,
where those servers might be managed by library IT (or other IT).
Switching from local IT infrastructure to
cloud based IT infrastructure
requires different types of technological skills
and suggests that conceptual knowledge
is paramount.
(This is my opinion, but it's based on years of
doing and teaching systems administration work.)
For example, it's more important to have a conceptual understanding
of how metadata works than to know how to use some
piece of software for managing metadata
(aside: however, conceptual and practical knowledge
cannot so easily be divorced from each other).
Metadata standards and schemes change far less often
than the software used to enter or administer metadata.</p>
<p>Cloud-based solutions have changed
the field in other ways.
Hosted software means
the software isn't purchased but leased,
and leasing involves outside vendors
who must have the technological skill sets
and resources to manage and provide the technology.
So we rely, in very important ways, and
are more dependent on other actors in the
publishing and e-resource provider ecosystem.
That involves a lot of trust, and
it involves more negotiations between
librarians and vendors, and
the ability to collaborate and develop good, ethical
relationships.
The kind of work that may increase,
as more software and data are hosted on the cloud,
might be the kind of work that requires strong communication
skills, strong negotiating skills, and
knowledge of how licensing works,
how copyright and contract law work, and
how electronic resource collections work and
inter-operate across platforms.
However, again, this can be complicated.
A couple of years ago there was an email
on the SERIALST listserv
by a librarian that asked whether librarians
have retained powers to negotiate and sign contracts.
The responses were mixed.
Some librarians had the jurisdiction but
many had lost it, per the email responses.
Even under this scenario, though,
technological understanding is necessary
in order to negotiate the best deal
for a library's stakeholders and
to acquire the best and
most seamless product needed by library users.</p>
<p>Even though IT continues to be outsourced,
this doesn't mean that we become lax
in our understanding of how the technology works;
just as we can't become lax in how librarianship
works even though librarians answer fewer reference questions
than they did in previous years
(i.e., you still need to know how to respond
systematically and thoroughly
to research and reference questions).
What I mean is that,
in order to communicate this topic well,
to negotiate well, and
to sign licenses that are beneficial to our communities,
it helps to understand and
be adept at the tech so that
we are not bamboozled in those negotiations.
Also, if something goes wrong,
e.g., with the link resolver technology,
we have to learn how to identify the problem;
that is, whether the technological issue
is the link resolver technology and not something else,
like the OPAC technology.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-1"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-1">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I want you to think about these
job advertisement studies in relation
to what you are learning about electronic resources
as well as in relation to the kinds of advertisements
you've seen since whenever you started paying attention to them,
like those outlined at the beginning of this section.
In essence, think about where you see yourself
in these advertisements and how they impact you.</p>
<p>Although it might be the case that most of you
haven't had a chance to learn electronic resource back ends,
that doesn't disqualify you from attempts
to start reflecting on this part of librarianship.
As library users of these technologies,
you have gathered enough abstract and practical knowledge
to know enough.</p>
<h3 id="questions-for-discussion"><a class="header" href="#questions-for-discussion">Questions for Discussion</a></h3>
<p>We'll soon move away from reflective questions and
get our hands dirty with specific technologies, licensing, etc.,
but for now let's reflect on the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you think you stand in comparison to ERM job ads and to <a href="https://www.nasig.org/Competencies-Eresources">NASIG Core
Competencies</a>?
<ul>
<li>Where are you strong?</li>
<li>Where would you like to improve?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What can you (and we, as a course community) do to help each of you get
there?
<ul>
<li>What's your path?</li>
<li>What can you practice?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do a job search for electronic resource management. How do the job ads align
with the how the position is described in the readings?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I think we might conclude at this point that there are many
different ways to frame the role of the
electronic resource librarian.
In <a href="01-the-erm-librarian.html">The ERM Librarian chapter</a>,
Stachokas (2018) showed how the
electronic resource librarian works across technical
services and collection development and
how this requires a holistic view as well as a specialized
understanding of the various processes involved.
Huleberg (2016) illustrated how framing
electronic resource librarianship as a technical
communicator yields important insights into the work
and profession.
Zhu (2016) used the licensing aspect of electronic resource
management work to show how central this activity
is to the field's identity.</p>
<p>In the
<a href="02-desperately-seeking-erm-librarian.html">Desperately Seeking an ERM Librarian</a>
section,
we reviewed a list of qualifications from current job
advertisements for electronic resource librarian positions.
In Murdock (2010),
we learned how these kinds of qualifications are tied
to various technological developments.
As the technology changes, and it changes a lot
(see <strong>aside</strong> below),
so do the qualifications.
One of the big takeaways from Harnett's (2014) article,
for me at least,
is that conceptual knowledge of the relevant technology
is more important than practical knowledge,
although the two are not always so easily divorced
from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: See The Library Technology Guides' page on
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/mergers/"><em>The History of Mergers and Acquisitions</em></a>
<em>in the Library Technology Industry</em> to get a sense of
how much change has taken place in the last 40+ years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the readings so far,
I think it's safe to say that the work of
electronic resource librarianship is one of
constant disruption.
And by that I mean,
it might be more difficult to find a thread of continuity,
from its early days to now,
in this role than it would be in other areas of
librarianship.
That might be part of what makes this area so interesting,
but it does present some challenges.</p>
<h2 id="framing-2"><a class="header" href="#framing-2">Framing</a></h2>
<p>The first listed reading we have this week is by
Marshall Breeding.
Astute observers will note Breeding is one of the
first cited authors in the two additional readings
we have this week.
We will read more from Breeding later, but
I bring him up now because he oversees a website titled
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/">Library Technology Guides</a>.
If you would like to keep abreast of the recent news
on the electronic resource industry,
Breeding's website should be at the top of your list.</p>
<p>Breeding's <em>What is ERM?</em> article is a good one
to start the week.
He provides an outline of the various components of
electronic resources, and
he provides some historical context for those components.</p>
<h3 id="the-focus-on-academic-libraries-is-misleading"><a class="header" href="#the-focus-on-academic-libraries-is-misleading">The Focus on Academic Libraries is Misleading</a></h3>
<p>One caveat, though:
while all the articles on our list this week are focused on
academic libraries,
the terms, concepts, and processes described
in these articles are relevant to other areas of
librarianship such as public librarianship,
school media librarianship, and so forth.
Differences in processes and in some details will
arise due to organizational or other contextual differences
among these library types.
Organizationally, for example, public libraries are
connected to municipalities, county governments,
state libraries, and to public library consortia.
This presents unique organizational challenges, and
it highlights the fact that municipal, county, or state laws
will define how some processes must be handled and
who must handle them.
The same is true for public schools, and in such cases,
school boards and school districts will likely be involved
(see <strong>aside</strong> below).
Contextual differences that shape electronic resource
management include user communities.
An academic library serves its students, faculty, staff, and
perhaps the public to some degree.
However, a public library serves its local community.
Such differences will shape ERM workflows and other choices,
like the chosen vendors and publishers.
For example, academic libraries provide more scholarly
sources, and public libraries provide more ebooks and
audiobooks and less e-journals.
This means that you might find services like
OverDrive/Libby, Epic, and Hoopla
offered by public libraries but not in academic ones, and
that you will rarely find more advanced scholarly resources
in public libraries.
These differences in needs, due to different communities,
will change the emphasis on some aspects
of the ERM workflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: As an example, see the impact that the current book bans are having on
ebook providers and note all the parties involved in these situations,
including: superintendents, county officials, county school system, school
district employees, etc. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/library-apps-book-ban-schools-conservative-parents-rcna26103">Ingram, 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a newer development, ChatGPT is being used to satisfy the legal
requirements <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/05/26/governor-signs-education-bills-including-ban-on-school-books-depicting-sex/">Iowa school districts (Opsahl, 2023)</a> must follow to
remove books that contain any sexual content from school libraries (<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/iowa-chatgpt-book-ban/">Paul,
2023</a>). There's a worthwhile response to criticisms about this
and about the overall law in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/opinion/book-ban-schools-iowa.html">recent New York Times article (Exman,
2023)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reason why our reading lists
lean toward the academic setting is not because
electronic resource management is not relevant to public
or other types of libraries, but it is because
academic librarians publish more about
electronic resources and public librarians publish very little.
For example, I conducted a search in <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/803">LISTA</a>
with the following query,
which returned just three results in 2021 when I first ran
the query, four results in August 2022, and four results again
in August 2023.
In fact, a new article wasn't published since the 2021
query. Rather, LISTA just added an addition item from 2015.</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>It does not get much better if I expand the query
to include some additional thesauri terms.
This query returns only six results in 2021,
seven in 2022, and eight in 2023:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;PUBLIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>However, if I focus that query on academic libraries,
then the results increase substantially.
The following query returns 51 hits in 2021, 57 in 2022, and 61 in 2023:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And this query returns 82 results in 2021, 90 in 2022, and 97 in 2023:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>We could continue to explore <strong>LISTA</strong> or other databases
for relevant material on ERM and public libraries, and
we would find more.
For example, more results are retrieved when I attach 
terms like <strong>e-resources</strong>, <strong>integrated library systems</strong>,
<strong>discovery platforms</strong>, or <strong>ebooks</strong> to a public library
search in LISTA.
But the results are nearly always much less than
academic library searches.
Another example, my local library system,
<a href="https://lexpublib.org/">Lexington Public Library</a>,
uses the <a href="https://librarytechnology.org/product/carlx/">CARL</a> integrated library system,
but there doesn't appear to be any articles in LISTA
about it since 2015.</p>
<p>Anyway, you get the picture.
There simply isn't a lot of material on
electronic resource management from the
public library perspective, and
a quick search in the school media sphere
mirrors this issue, too.
The following search return zero results in 2021, 2022, and 2023:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;LIBRARY media specialists&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>If you go into public librarianship or
school media librarianship,
I'd encourage you to publish on electronic resources.
It would greatly benefit your peers and those of us
who teach courses like this.</p>
<p>Back to Breeding.
I understand some terms Breeding uses and the technologies
he describes might still be new to us.
Let me spend some time providing some additional
background information and highlighting some things
to look for in these three articles.</p>
<p>Librarians started to migrate to
electronic resource management in the 1970s.
Breeding mentions this, but the seeds were
planted well before this.
Nearly a decade ago, I published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2013.0051">a paper</a> that
provides a historical account of the first library
automation project,
which took place in the 1930s with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">Hollerith punched cards</a>.
By the 1960s,
the primary use of computers was to manage circulation, and
in the late 60s and early 70s,
library automation focused on managing patron records.
In the early 1970s, tools became available to manage and
search bibliographic records.
Hence, computers were first used mostly to manage the
circulation of books,
then patron records,
which allowed patrons to check out works <em>electronically</em>,
and then we had the ability to search for works.
If a work of interest was located using these tools,
the work could be retrieved from the shelves or ordered
via interlibrary loan by snail mail.
Full text search came much later with the introduction
of better storage media, like CD-ROMs, and
saw major growth with the introduction of the internet to
more institutions in the 1980s
and the web in the early 1990s,
which at its heart is nothing more than a big
document retrieval system.</p>
<p>In the process of migrating from print to electronic,
all sorts of things had to change, but
all that change rests on the major premise of librarianship:
<strong>to provide access by organizing information
in order to retrieve information</strong>.
Although you may have often heard that libraries
are ancient entities,
libraries and librarianship as we understand them today
did not modernize until the late 1800s but more
so starting in the 1920s and 1930s.
It during this later time frame when some in the profession began to hone in on
the major complexities and challenges,
social and technological,
involved in <strong>organizing</strong> and <strong>retrieving</strong> information
in order to provide <strong>access</strong>.
The challenges with organizing and retrieving information
that they identified nearly 100 years ago were indeed
major and problematic, but fortuitous,
because it gave rise to what we now called
<em>library science</em>,
the rigorous study of libraries, librarianship, collections,
users, communities, and so forth.</p>
<p>Yet consider when those people laid the groundwork
for a library science nearly 100 years ago,
librarians only managed print, and the primary means of
accessing print collections was through a physical building.
With the introduction of computer systems in the 1960s and
with better networking technologies in the 1980s and 1990s,
issues with organizing and retrieving information grew
exponentially, and indeed,
this exponential increase created new complexities and launched
an entire new field, what we now call <em>information science</em>.</p>
<p>All right, back to the ground level.
Let me highlight some key terms in Breeding's article.
They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding aids</li>
<li>Knowledge bases</li>
<li>OpenURL link resolvers</li>
<li>ERM systems</li>
<li>Library service platforms (LSP)</li>
<li>Integrated library systems (ILS)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Not all but many of the above terms are defined in <a href="https://odlis.abc-clio.com/">ODLIS: Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless you already have some solid experience
with these things, and even after reading Breeding's
article, these terms may still be abstract.
So, this week, you have two major tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find real, practical examples. Pick one or two of the above terms and see
how they work in practice. Then come back here and tell us what you found.
Use the articles to help you locate actual products or examples. See
Breedings <a href="https://librarytechnology.org/">Library Technology Guides</a> for reference.</li>
<li>Locate how these terms appear in either the Cote and Ostergaard (2017)
article or the Fu and Carmen (2015). Note other terms that may appear in
those two articles and comment on the role they play in the ERM workflow
and the migration process.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="workflow"><a class="header" href="#workflow">Workflow</a></h3>
<p>As you work on this task,
I ask that you pay attention to the emphasis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow">workflow</a>.
The idea of a <strong>workflow</strong> is a major theme in this course
because it is a major part of
electronic resource management.
We'll come back to the idea throughout this work.
Also, as we read the Cote and Ostergaard (2017) and
the Fu and Carmen (2015) article,
we will learn about how migrating to new systems is a
major, expensive, and time-consuming project, and
one of the great things about
these two articles is that it documents the workflows
used in these migrations.
If you become involved some day in a migration process,
you should use articles like these to assist you and
to help you make evidence-based decisions about what
you need to accomplish.
And like what these authors have done,
I would encourage you to document and publish what you learned.
In the print era,
there were some cases where librarians had
to migrate to new systems, too.
For example, some research libraries in the U.S.
started by classifying collections using the
Dewey Decimal Classification system, but
then began to convert to the
Library of Congress Classification system after
the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.
This was no small task.
Today, migration is big business in the library world
(see Breeding's site for other examples)
because the technology changes fast and
because there are a number of competing electronic resource
management products that librarians can choose
for their communities,
which they might be inclined to do if the migration
provides an advantage to their users, communities,
and themselves.</p>

<p>The chapter offers an introductory examination
of key aspects within the field of
electronic resource management (ERM) and library technology.
Spanning four integral sections,
the following sections explore:</p>
<ol>
<li>The intricate relationship between electronic resource management systems
and integrated library systems. These systems are essential for the
organization and distribution of digital content;</li>
<li>The vital role of standards in ERM, which ensures uniformity and efficiency
across electronic resources and workflows;</li>
<li>Insights into data and software interoperability, allowing for seamless
interaction between diverse systems and platforms; and</li>
<li>A detailed analysis of electronic access and authentication, safeguarding
and controlling access to digital resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Together, these lectures provide both aspiring
information professionals and seasoned librarians
a well-rounded understanding of the
technological and methodological considerations
that shape modern librarianship.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-3"><a class="header" href="#introduction-3">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This week we learn about ERM and ILS software.
What are these?</p>
<h2 id="ils-the-integrated-library-system"><a class="header" href="#ils-the-integrated-library-system">ILS, the Integrated Library System</a></h2>
<p><strong>ILS</strong> is an acronym for an <strong>integrated library system</strong>.
We were introduced to the newer term
<strong>library services platform (LSP)</strong>
in the previous section.
Although different in many ways
(<a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/issue/view/509">Breeding, 2015</a>;
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/25609">Breeding, 2020</a>),
our discussions of the ILS and LSP
this week are relevant
to those types of integrated library systems
that may also be library service platforms,
the latter which are
becoming more common these days.</p>
<p>The differences between ISP and LSP
are both large and small.
The main idea between them is the same
in the sense that they are both
&quot;used by librarians to manage their internal
work and external services,&quot; such as
&quot;acquiring and describing collection resources,
making those resources available to their
users through appropriate channels, and
other areas of their [resource management] operations&quot;
(<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/25609">Breeding, 2020, para. 1</a>).</p>
<h3 id="administration"><a class="header" href="#administration">Administration</a></h3>
<p>In order to provide the above functions,
the ILS/LSP has an administrative interface
that librarians use to manage their resources.
The interface contains a set of
modules that are common among most software solutions,
although they may be named variously.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/acquisitions/">acquisitions</a></li>
<li>authority files</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/cataloging/">cataloging</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/circulation/">circulation</a></li>
<li>course reserves</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/opac/">online catalogs</a></li>
<li>patron management</li>
<li>reports</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/serials/">serials</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the above list,
I've linked to documentation on modules provided by
the <a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen</a> open source ILS system.
LibLime's <a href="https://liblime.com/bibliovation/">Bibliovation</a> LSP offers
comparably named modules for 
discovery, circulation, cataloging, serials,
acquisitions, and systems administration.
Other ILS/LSP solutions may offer specific modules
dedicated to other items in the list,
or those functions might be integrated into
one of the above modules.
Alternatively, new modules appear in LSPs
that that take advantage of special LSP abilities
and digital assets.
For example, the <a href="https://exlibrisgroup.com/products/alma-library-services-platform/">Alma LSP</a>
provides modules dedicated to
acquisitions, resources, discovery (via Primo),
fulfillment, administration, and analytics.
This is part of what differentiates a LSP
from an ILS.
Please take a moment and read
about these modules in
<a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen's</a> documentation,
which is an ILS,
and visit the Alma and LibLime links to
learn more about their specifically LSP products.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface"><a class="header" href="#user-interface">User Interface</a></h3>
<p>Each of you are familiar with an
ILS/LSP from a user perspective and
some of you are familiar with these systems
from a librarian perspective.
In your lifetimes, you have used OPACs
(online public access catalogs) or
<strong>discovery systems</strong> like <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY&amp;lang=en">InfoKat</a>,
which uses Alma's Primo discovery system,
you have likely conducted a search for a serial, and
you have most definitely borrowed
a book from a library.
The ILS/LSP makes these end user functions possible.</p>
<p>Until fairly recently,
the <strong>OPAC</strong>
was the primary way to locate and access
items in library collections.
However, in LSPs
the OPAC has evolved into a <strong>discovery system</strong>,
depending on what and
how it searches its records and other factors.
The <em>Encyclopedia of Knowledge Organization</em>
describes the differences as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OPACs replicated and extended the functionality of the
card catalogues they largely replaced in providing a
finding aid to the books, journals, audiovisual material
and other holdings of a particular library. The term
<em>discovery system</em> has come into use in the early
Twenty-first century to describe public-facing electronic
catalogues which use the technology of the Internet search
engines to expand the scope of the OPAC to include not
only library-held content, including entries for journal
articles and book chapters that were not typically part of
traditional library catalogues, but also material held
elsewhere which may be of interest to clients
<a href="https://www.isko.org/cyclo/opac">(Wells, 2021)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, OPACS generally searched against
pre-defined fields that are recorded in MARC such as
author, title, subject, etc. and searched collections,
at first print but later electronic, held by the library.
A discovery system can search additional text,
if available, and can more easily link to items
not in the library collection but which can be acquired 
through interlibrary loan.
A discovery system can also integrate with bibliographic
databases and
return results indexed by those databases.
This saves the user from having to know about
specific topical databases.
For example, UK Libraries provides access to
over 700 databases, and
thus having a discovery system that can access
those is beneficial.
However, none of the above mean that a discovery system,
like InfoKat,
is aware of the totality of a library's collections.
(And it's not always clear what's left out.)</p>
<h3 id="in-totality"><a class="header" href="#in-totality">In Totality</a></h3>
<p>These administrative and end user interfaces
make up the totality of the ILS/LSP software.
In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>administrative interface</strong> is used by librarians to
manage tasks provided through modules.</li>
<li>a <strong>public interface</strong>, such as an OPAC or discovery
system, is used by librarians and patrons to access the
library's collections.</li>
</ul>
<p>An ILS/LSP is therefore,
as Stephen Salmon stated in 1975,
a &quot;non-traditional&quot; way of doing traditional things,
such as &quot;acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation,&quot;
but which has now become fairly routine!</p>
<p>Electronic resource librarians might work extensively with
specific resources or modules
in order to administer
the library's digital assets
(e.g., contracts, etc.),
but all librarians use one or more of the ILS/LSP modules.
For example,
when I worked in reference at a small academic library,
I used the Millennium ILS to check out books to users,
to fix borrowing issues,
and to search for works in the OPAC.
Later I primarily used the cataloging module when
I moved to technical services.
What a librarian uses frequently depends
on the organizational structure of a library.
As our reading by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01462679.2014.901200">Miller, Sharp, and Jones (2014)</a> show,
the rise in electronic resources has vastly influenced
the ways librarians structure their organizations,
whose structures were originally informed
by the dictates of a &quot;print-based world&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="erms-the-electronic-resource-management-system"><a class="header" href="#erms-the-electronic-resource-management-system">ERMS, the Electronic Resource Management System</a></h2>
<p>ERMS is an acronym for <em>electronic resource management system</em>.
Its function is born from the need to manage
a library's <strong>digital assets</strong>,
for example, the licenses that a library has signed.
In order to manage assets like licenses,
the ERMS can keep track of the signatories,
the terms of the license/contracts,
specific documents related to these processes,
and more.
An ERMS may or may not be integrated
with a library's ILS software.
But it's most likely integrated in a LSP solution.
The Alma LSP, for example, is a LSP that also provides
<a href="https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/Electronic_Resource_Management">electronic resource management</a>.
In short,
a library that uses an ILS may also be using
a separate ERMS product.
However, many LSPs have built in
ERMS functionality,
thereby not requiring a second ERMS product.</p>
<p>Like the ILS/LSP,
ERM software is generally divided into modules
that focus the librarian's work on particular duties
and allow librarians to create work flows and
knowledge management systems.
In an ERM like the open source
<a href="http://coral-erm.org/modules/">CORAL system</a>,
the modules include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/resources/">Resources</a>: a module &quot;provides a robust
database for tracking data related to your organization's
resources ...&quot; and &quot;provides a customizable workflow tool
that can be used to track, assign, and complete workflow
tasks.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/licensing/">Licensing</a>: a module for a &quot;flexible
document management system&quot; that provides options to
manage licensing agreements and to automate parts of the
process.</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/organizations/">Organizations</a>: this module acts as
a type of advanced directory to manage the various
organizations that impact or are involved in the
management of electronic resources, including &quot;publishers,
vendors, consortia, and more.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/usage-statistics/">Usage Statistics</a>: a module providing
librarians with usage statistics of digital assets by
platform and by publisher. Supports COUNTER and SUSHI.
We'll cover COUNTER and SUSHI later in the semester, but
as a preamble:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/about/counter-for-libraries/">COUNTER</a> &quot;sets and maintains the standard
known as the Code of Practice and ensures that
publishers and vendors submit annually to a rigorous
independent audit&quot;, and,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/sushi">SUSHI</a> is a type of protocol to automate
collecting data on usage statistics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/management/">Management</a>: this module provides a
document management system aimed at &quot;storing documents,
such as policies, processes, and procedures, related to
the overall management of electronic resources&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="readings"><a class="header" href="#readings">Readings</a></h2>
<p>In our readings this week,
we have three articles that speak to
ILS/LSP and ERM software solutions
and the relationship between the two.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14955">Fournie (2020)</a> notes,
the electronic resource market is consolidating
into a few heavyweights but that this trend does not
have to force libraries into solutions that
lead to vendor lock-in or acceptance of <em>walled gardens</em>.
In the process, Fournie (2020) describes two
ERM solutions: Coral and Folio.
The author's descriptions are helpful in understanding
what these two software solutions are capable of providing.</p>
<p>The readings by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01462679.2014.901200">Miller, Sharp, and Jones (2014)</a>
and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2020.1717032">Bahnmaier, Sherfey, and Hatfield (2020)</a>
provides some context about how these
technologies impact librarianship.
Miller et al. (2014) describe a case study
(the literature review is also helpful)
that shows how electronic resources have
impacted organizational structure,
job titles, budgets, and more.
Likewise Bahnmaier et al. (2020) discuss aspects of this
as well as reflect on various changes in library staffing
and how this raises the importance of the library-vendor
relationship.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-2">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>With that background in mind,
in this week's forum,

especially any documentation.
I'll ask that you log into the relevant services,
test the demos sites, or
watch the demo videos.
This will help get some hands-on experience
with them and also demystify what each do.</p>
<h2 id="addendum"><a class="header" href="#addendum">Addendum</a></h2>
<p>In prior semesters, we read articles by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v31i3.1914">Wang and Dawes (2012)</a> and
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2011.10765404">Wilson (2011)</a>.
I replaced those readings for the Fall 2022 semester,
but for those interested,
I briefly describe them below.</p>
<p>In the article by Wang and Dawes (2012),
the authors describe the
&quot;next generation integrated library system&quot;,
which should meet a few criteria that
include the ability to merge ILS software with ERM software.
ERM software solutions exist because
integrated library systems (ILS) failed to include
functions to manage digital assets.
Basically, the ILS was still behaving with a print-mindset,
so to speak, and
was growing stagnant.
Around the time the article was published,
more ILS and ERM software began moving to the cloud,
as was common among many software markets.
This changed the game
because it placed a bigger burden on
software companies to maintain their software.
Based on demand and need,
the LSP was created as a next-generation
ILS that included ERM functionality.
So it's likely that even though the LSP might
replace the ILS/ERM combo someday,
it could be that we'll live in a dual world where
some libraries use a LSP and some use the LSP/ERM combo.</p>
<p>Despite the technical aspects of these solutions,
at its basic,
both ILS/LSP and ERM software solutions focus
on managing assets
(books, serials, <a href="https://archives.yale.edu/subjects/33488">realia</a>, etc)
so that librarians can organize and
users and librarians can retrieve those assets.
There's no requirement to use any solution
offered by a library vendor, and
that's the point of the
Wilson (2011) article,
which shows how regular software can be used
to function as a homegrown solution for
creating and implementing an ERM work flow.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-4"><a class="header" href="#introduction-4">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Awhile ago now,
I conducted some historical research
on a librarian named Ralph Parker.
Inspired by technological advances in automation,
specifically the use of the punched cards and machines,
Parker began to apply this technology
to library circulation processes in the 1930s and
thus became the first person to automate part of the
library's work flow.
By the mid-1960s,
Parker's decades long pursuit of library automation
led to some major advances,
including the founding of <a href="https://www.oclc.org/">OCLC</a>.
Meanwhile, the punched card system he continued to
develop eventually led to massive increases
in circulation and better service to patrons.
In the mid-60s he wrote the following about
the installation and launch of a new punched card system
to help automate circulation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the delight of the patrons it requires only four
seconds to check out materials (as cited in Burns, 2014).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think about that quote often.
When I read that in his annual report in the archives
at the University of Missouri,
I could feel his giddiness with these results.
Until this achievement,
when a patron borrowed an item from the library,
the process involved completing multiple forms
in order to be sure that accurate records were kept.
Accurate record keeping is important.
Libraries need to protect their collections but
also provide access to them.
As stated in the <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027387052">Flexner (1927)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is necessary that the library have control of these
circulating books in several ways. It [the library] must
know where they are, it must lay down rules to see that
thoughtless people do not retain the books in their
possession unfairly, and it must provide means for
securing their prompt return. These and many other
considerations combine to make it necessary for the [
circulation ] department to install and maintain very
efficient methods to control the circulation of books,
which are commonly known as routines (p. 6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What were those routines in the 1930s and thenabouts?
Why was Parker so excited about his system taking
only four seconds to check out a work?
Well, two routines are important for circulation.
The first involves membership and the
second involves charging or checking out works.</p>
<h3 id="membership"><a class="header" href="#membership">Membership</a></h3>
<p>First, if the patron was not yet a member of a library,
then they had to register to become one;
hence, the first routine was to check their membership and
register them as borrowers if they were not yet a member
or if their membership had expired.
If this was a public library,
then the process might vary a bit depending if
the member was an adult or a youth
(or <em>juveniles</em> in the lingo of the time).
Regardless, this routine basically involved completing
an application card, creating a member record and
filing that away for the library's use, and
then giving the borrower a card of their own,
i.e., their <strong>borrower's card</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="charging"><a class="header" href="#charging">Charging</a></h3>
<p>Once membership status was confirmed or created,
then the circulation librarian employed a system
to <strong>charge</strong> books to the borrower.
Several systems had been employed up through the late 1920s,
including the <strong>ledger system</strong>,
the <strong>dummy system</strong>,
the <strong>temporary slip system</strong>,
the <strong>permanent slip or card system</strong>,
the <strong>Browne system</strong>, and
eventually the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Newark%20charging%20system">Newark charging system</a>
(see <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027387052">Flexner, 1927, pp. 73-82 for details</a>).
Assuming the librarian in the 1930s used
the Newark system,
when a book was to be checked out,
the librarian needed to enter the details on a
&quot;book card, a date slip and a book pocket for each book&quot;
(Flexner, 1927, p. 78).
Flexner goes on to outline the process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date slip is pasted opposite the pocket at the back of
the book. The date which indicates when the book is due to
be returned or when issued is stamped on each of three
records, the reader's card, the book card and the date
slip. The borrower's number is copied opposite the date on
the book card. The date on the date slip indicates at once
the file in which the book card is to be found, and the
[librarian] assistant is able to discharge the book and
release the borrower immediately on the return of the
volume (Flexner, 1927, pp. 78-79).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence,
charging books or works to patrons involved
a lot of paperwork, and
you can imagine that it might be prone to error.
However, the number of systems at the time and
the discussions and debates around them show
that the processes and routines were steadily
becoming standardized, and
standardization is a necessary pre-requisite to automation.</p>
<p>Parker's achievement in automation eventually
improved the library experience for patrons
as well as the librarians at the circulation desk, and
indirectly their colleagues throughout the library.
That is, once circulation standards stabilized,
and once technology like punched cards
became available generally,
then it became possible to automate this
process for the library.
And this was good;
the effects were that automation increased circulation
and that an automated circulation process
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._R._Ranganathan">Saved The Time Of The Reader</a>,
<em>down to four seconds to be exact!</em></p>
<p>This is all to say that standards and technology
go hand and hand and that the details matter
when thinking about standards.
How does this relationship work?
Standards enable multiple groups of competing
interests to form consensus around
how technologyshould work, and
when this happens,
multiple parties receive payoffs at the expense
of any single party acquiring a monopoly.
This is true for the design of screwdrivers,
the width of railroad tracks,
the temperature scale, and
certainly also for how information is managed and exchanged.
The internet and the web wouldn't exist or
definitely not exist as we know it if not for
the standardization of the Internet Protocol (IP),
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
and other internet and web related technologies
that enable the internet and the web to work
for so many users regardless of the operating system and
the hardware they use.</p>
<h2 id="readings-1"><a class="header" href="#readings-1">Readings</a></h2>
<p>Our first article this week by Harris (2006)
covers the basic reasons for the existence of
<a href="http://www.niso.org/">NISO</a>
(the <em>National Information Standards Organization</em>)
and the kinds of standards NISO is responsible
for maintaining and creating.
These standards are directly related to
libraries and fall under
<a href="https://www.niso.org/welcome-to-niso">three broad categories</a>
related to <strong>Information Creation &amp; Curation</strong>,
<strong>Information Discovery &amp; Interchange</strong>, and
<strong>Information Policy &amp; Analysis</strong>.
There are standards that touch on bibliographic information,
indexing, abstracting, controlled vocabularies, and
many other library important issues.
If you have not before paid attention to NISO,
you might now start seeing more references to the
organization and the standards it publishes,
especially because the international
library community has worked closely with NISO
to develop standards for various aspects of library work.</p>
<p>Another historical note:
As Harris (2006) elaborates in the article,
NISO came into existence in the mid-1930s.
This was about the same time that Ralph Parker
began working on his punched card system.
Not long before this, in the late 1920s,
the first library science graduate program
launched at the University of Chicago, and
in the early 1930s,
the first research based journal started,
<em>The Library Quarterly</em>.
We often hear how long libraries have existed,
and it's true that there were quite a
few accomplishments before the 1930s, but
it is this time period
(for these and a number of other reasons)
that marks the modern era of libraries.</p>
<p>We also are not simply interested in
standardizing things like the forms used
to catalog and charge a book,
to create member records,
to draw up licenses for an electronic resources,
as we'll discuss later.
We are also interested in standardizing,
as Flexner (1927) would say,
&quot;routines&quot;, processes, or workflows.
Thus, our additional readings are on TERMS,
or <em>Techniques for Electronic Resource Management</em>.
TERMS is not a true standard, but
more of a <em>de facto</em> or proposed standard that
helps outline the electronic resource management work flow.
It was developed in order for librarians
or others dealing with electronic resources to come
to a consensus on the processes of
electronic resource management.
Version 1 of TERMS is described by the TERMS authors
in an issue of <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/issue/view/192">Library Technology Reports</a>.
Although it has been replaced by a <a href="http://6terms.tumblr.com/">newer version</a>,
it still functions as a thorough introduction
to the ERM work flow and provides guidance and
suggestions on all aspects of
electronic resource management.
For example, in <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4738/5647">chapter 7</a> of the LTS report
on TERMS version 1,
the authors provide information
on the importance of working with providers or
vendors in case of cancellation of a resource.
They write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not burn any bridges! Many resources have
postcancellation access, which means you need to keep up a
working relationship with suppliers; this might also incur
a platform access fee going forward, so this needs to be
budgeted for in future years. Review the license to fully
understand what your postcancellation rights to access may
be. In addition, you may resubscribe to the resources in
future years. Content is bought and sold by publishers and
vendors. Therefore, you may end up back with your original
vendor a year or two down the line!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of this material is repeated in version 2 of TERMS,
but version 2 was created in order to address changes and
to include more input from the community.
Version 2 also includes a slightly modified outline, and
<a href="https://library.hud.ac.uk/archive/projects/terms/announcing-terms-ver2-0/">includes the following parts</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Investigating new content for purchase or addition</li>
<li>Acquiring new content</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Ongoing evaluation and access, and annual review</li>
<li>Cancellation and replacement review</li>
<li>Preservation</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same link just provided,
they also write about this new version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the works mentioned or cited in the
original TERMS report, much has been written in the past
few years that can help the overwhelmed or incoming
electronic resources librarian manage their daily
workflow. In the end, however, most of the challenges
facing the management of electronic resources is directly
related to workflow management. How we manage these
challenging or complex resources is more important than
what we do, because how we do it informs how successful
and how meaningful the work is, and how well it completes
our goal of getting access to patrons who want to use
these resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such,
the outline and the content described
in these two versions of TERMS is very much centered
on the ERM work flow.
TERMS is a guide and framework for thinking
on the different aspects of the electronic resource
life-cycle within the library, and
it helps provide librarians with a set of questions and
points of investigation.
For example, let's consider Term item 1,
which is to investigate new content
for purchase or addition.
In a presentation by the
<a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/19420/">Emery and Stone (2014)</a>,
they suggest that this involves the following steps,
partly paraphrased:</p>
<ul>
<li>outline what you want to achieve</li>
<li>create a specification document</li>
<li>assemble the right team</li>
<li>review the market and literature and set up trial</li>
<li>speak with suppliers and vendors</li>
<li>make a decision (Emery and Stone, slide 12, 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>Emery and Stone (2014) provide other examples, and
the TERMS listed in this slide are from the first version.
TERM no. 6, PRESERVATION, was added in version 2, and
TERMS nos. 4 and 5 from version 1 were joined together.</p>
<h2 id="exercise"><a class="header" href="#exercise">Exercise</a></h2>
<p>This week you have a two part exercise:</p>
<h3 id="first"><a class="header" href="#first">First</a></h3>
<p>Visit the NISO website and search for documentation
on a standard, recommended practices, or technical reports
and post about it.
The differences between these publications follows:</p>
<p><strong>Technical reports:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NISO Technical Reports provide useful information about a
particular topic, but do not make specific recommendations
about practices to follow. They are thus &quot;descriptive&quot;
rather than &quot;prescriptive&quot; in nature. Proposed standards
that do not result in consensus may get published as
technical reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommended Practices:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NISO Recommended Practices are &quot;best practices&quot; or
&quot;guidelines&quot; for methods, materials, or practices in order
to give guidance to the user. These documents usually
represent a leading edge, exceptional model, or proven
industry practice. All elements of Recommended Practices
are discretionary and may be used as stated or modified by
the user to meet specific needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Published and Approved NISO Standards:</strong></p>
<p>These are the final, approved definitions
that have been achieved by a consensus of the community.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards">https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards</a>
for the descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="second"><a class="header" href="#second">Second</a></h3>
<p>After reading about TERMS,
try to place these TERMS in additional
electronic resource management context.
Please draw from your experience
using the ILS and ERM software,
from the readings,
your personal work experience in a library,
if you have that, or
use your imagination.
Specifically, it would be interesting if
you could pick out aspects of systems
like Coral or Folio that appear
to facilitate standardized workflows.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-5"><a class="header" href="#introduction-5">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Managing electronic resources in libraries involves
a complex web of technologies and services,
each with its own set of challenges.
One such challenge is the intricacy of navigating
paywalls to access a library's digital content.
This section examines the complications that arise
when accessing paywalled materials.
We explore how technologies like OpenURL link resolvers
can streamline this process and
enhance interoperability between multiple services.</p>
<h2 id="problem"><a class="header" href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>
<p>We take it for granted that
we can seamlessly follow links to
websites and webpages on the web,
or do so without too much fuss.
It gets more complicated
when we want access to works that are behind paywalls,
despite where such works have been found:
search engines, bibliographic databases,
OPACs (online public access catalogs),
or discovery services.
In these cases,
direct links to sources identified in these services
do not always work.</p>
<p>The issue becomes complex
when a library subscribes to a journal or magazine.
Access is often provided through third-party services,
not just the publisher's default site.
Example third-party services include bibliographic databases,
like EBSCOhost or ProQuest.
Also, libraries provide multiple discovery points and
multiple ways to access the same works,
such as through bibliographic databases
with overlapping scopes.
Bibliographic databases can tell
us that an item exists when we search for it,
but a library may not subscribe to the publication
or the item might be in the stacks,
stored off site or at another library altogether.
These issues,
along with the challenges presented by paywalls,
necessitate additional layers of complexity,
such as the use of proxy servers for user authentication,
that make access more complicated.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example.
The journal <em>Serials Librarian</em> is published
by <em>Taylor &amp; Francis Online</em> / <em>Routledge</em>, and
has the following site as its homepage:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/wser20">https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/wser20</a></p>
<p>The journal is indexed in <em>EBSCOhost</em>'s
<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/803">Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts</a>
(LISTA) database
and in <em>ProQuest</em>'s
<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/3355">Social Science Premium Collection</a> (SSPC) database,
among other places
(e.g., it can also be found in <em>Google Scholar</em>,
<em>Google Search</em>, a library's discovery platform,
and more).
This means that an article like the following
can show up based on a query on any of the above platforms,
even if none of these search or discovery platforms provide
full text access to the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brown, D. (2021). &quot;Through a glass, darkly:: Lessons learned
starting over as an electronic resources librarian. <em>The
Serials Librarian, 81</em>(3–4), 246–252.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2021.2008581">https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2021.2008581</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these <strong>access points</strong> are good for the user,
but they present a technological problem, too.
That problem is:
how do I link to the main source?</p>
<p>One way to know if our library provides access
to the above source and others like it is 
through a link resolver.
We see UK's link resolver in action when
we see a <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> button or link.
When we click on that button or link in
a database like the above mentioned LISTA or SSPC,
we trigger the link resolver,
and that routes us through
the library's discovery service.
In <em>LISTA</em>, that link looks like this:</p>

<p>Clicking on either of the above links in their
respective databases sends us to <em>Primo</em>,
UK Library's discovery layer.</p>
<p>If we had clicked on <em>EBSCOhost</em>'s View Now link,
the <em>Primo</em> link will result in the following:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?institution=01SAA_UKY&amp;vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY&amp;date=20220701&amp;issue=3%2F4&amp;isbn=&amp;spage=246&amp;title=Serials%20Librarian&amp;atitle=%22Through%20a%20Glass,%20Darkly%22:%20Lessons%20Learned%20Starting%20over%20as%20an%20Electronic%20Resources%20Librarian.&amp;sid=EBSCO:Library,%20Information%20Science%20%26%20Technology%20Abstracts:156075536&amp;volume=81&amp;pages=246-252&amp;issn=0361526X&amp;au=Brown,%20Daniel&amp;genre=article&amp;ID=doi:10.1080%2F0361526X.2021.2008581
</code></pre>
<p>Look closely at those links
(scroll to the right to view their entirety),
and you will see that the article's <strong>metadata</strong> is
embedded in the URLs.
Among other things,
you can see the publication title, the article title,
the author's name, the DOI, and more.</p>
<p>That metadata is used to trigger a search
query in the library's discovery platform
(at UK, that's <em>InfoKat Discovery</em> by <em>Primo</em>).
It specifically initiates a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">GET HTTP Request</a>,
which is designed to request data from a resource/server,
in this case <em>InfoKat Discovery</em>, using
the metadata embedded in the URLs.</p>
<p>This is primarily the work of an OpenURL link resolver,
which is designed to provide access
to a <em>target</em> (main content)
despite the <em>source</em> (where item was found)
by initiating queries in an OPAC or discovery
platform using the metadata embedded in a URL.</p>
<p>OpenURL is a technical solution to the paywall problem.
It is designed to help users of
electronic resources access a source in a
library's collection based on a citation/record
that the user discovered in a search result,
an article's list of references,
or wherever else the link resolver might show up.
It is meant to work for all items in a library's collection,
including print items,
since print items have records in the catalog
or discovery service, and
those records have their own URLs.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases"><a class="header" href="#use-cases">Use Cases</a></h2>
<h3 id="google-scholar-example"><a class="header" href="#google-scholar-example"><em>Google Scholar</em> Example</a></h3>
<p>Let's consider a search scenario in <em>Google Scholar</em>.
To start,
users can affiliate themselves with a specific library
through Google Scholar's settings.
Once that affiliation has been set up,
Google Scholar leverages a <em>knowledge base</em>
(a structured database containing details
about a library's collections)
to facilitate access to paywalled content.</p>
<p>It works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metadata extraction</strong>: Google Scholar extracts the article's (or other
content) metadata, which includes details such as the title, author, DOI, and
publication year, from its database.</li>
<li><strong>Administrative metadata</strong>: Additional metadata about the institution, such
as an institutional ID number, is added to this information.</li>
<li><strong>URL query formation</strong>: This collective metadata is converted into a URL
query designed to search the library's collections through its discovery
service.</li>
<li><strong>User presentation</strong>: Users are presented with various <strong>target options</strong>
for retrieving the article, or in some cases, they are taken directly to the
full text (e.g., if only one target option exists in their library's
collections).</li>
</ul>
<p>The term <strong>target options</strong> refers to the different ways
to obtain the article or acquire access to other content.
These options may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full text access from various and possibly multiple vendors or publishers.
This is why a record in a discovery service may have multiple links to
content.</li>
<li>Information about the article's physical location if available on a library's
shelves.</li>
<li>Options to request the work through interlibrary loan.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To link <em>Google Scholar</em> to an affiliation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://scholar.google.com">https://scholar.google.com/</a></li>
<li>Open Settings</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Library Links</strong> tab</li>
<li>Search for your affiliation
<ul>
<li>e.g., University of Kentucky</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add and save</li>
</ol>
<p>Now when you search in <em>Google Scholar</em>,
you should see <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> links
(if your affiliation is University of Kentucky)
next to search results that your affiliation has
in its collections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

useful to read through.

</blockquote>
<p>Consider conducting a basic keyword search in <strong>Google Scholar</strong>
using the term <em>electronic resources</em>.
If you are affiliated with a specific library,
let's take the University of Kentucky (UK) as an example,
you should see a <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link next to at least
some of the search results.
An <strong>OpenURL</strong>,
which we will dissect in detail later,
contains the article's metadata and identifies
Google as the source:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01SAA_UKY/01SAA_UKY:UKY?sid=google&amp;auinit=PS&amp;aulast=Dadzie&amp;atitle=Electronic+resources:+access+and+usage+at+Ashesi+University+College&amp;id=doi:10.1108/10650740510632208
</code></pre>
<p>The original publisher of this article is Emerald,
and the full text is available through <em>Emerald eJournals Premier</em>.
This information is processed by Primo,
UK's discovery and delivery service.
Primo redirects our query to the UK Library's
proxy service, <strong>OpenAthens</strong>
(as of the summer of 2023;
formerly it was <strong>EZProxy</strong>).
After authenticating ourselves using our
secure (we hope!) university account login,
we gain access to the full text from Emerald.</p>
<p>Should alternative databases like
EBSCOhost and/or ProQuest provide access,
and not the original publisher
(e.g., Emerald in this case),
Primo would present us with options to select
our preferred database for viewing the full text.</p>
<p>In scenarios where there is only one source to the content
provided by the library,
the transfer to Primo to OpenAthens to the Emerald full-text
occurs swiftly,
providing a seamless user experience.</p>
<h2 id="dissecting-an-openurl"><a class="header" href="#dissecting-an-openurl">Dissecting an OpenURL</a></h2>
<p>Understanding the anatomy of an OpenURL
can help us comprehend how metadata
is transmitted and processed within library systems.
As an example,
let's dissect a specific Primo URL to identify
its individual components.</p>
<p>The following Primo URL is an OpenURL link,
which means Primo follows the standards of OpenURL.
(See <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/z3988-2004-r2010">ANSI/NISO Z39.88-2004 (R2021) The OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive Services</a>.
It is composed of various fields
and values that make up the metadata.
For readability,
I have broken up the URL into individual lines by
metadata fields.
The metadata fields begin after the <strong>openurl?</strong> keyword:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?
institution=01SAA_UKY&amp;
vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY&amp;
aulast=Dadzie&amp;
id=doi:10.1108%2F10650740510632208&amp;
auinit=PS&amp;
atitle=Electronic%20resources%20access%20and%20usage%20at%20Ashesi%20University%20College&amp;
sid=google
</code></pre>
<p>The link resolver technology,
which operates in the background,
translates the metadata to interact
with appropriate library services.
In this specific URL,
the 'institution', 'vid', and 'sid' fields
serve as <strong>administrative metadata</strong>
that help to identify the institution and source information.
The key fields used to retrieve the article are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aulast</strong>: The author's last name</li>
<li><strong>id</strong>: The DOI (Digital Object Identifier)</li>
<li><strong>auinit</strong>: The author's first two initials</li>
<li><strong>atitle</strong>: The title of the article</li>
</ul>
<p>These fields play crucial roles in ensuring
that the correct resources are fetched
from the library's database,
making the OpenURL an important element in providing access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One feature of the above URL is Percent-encoding,
a process used to encode URL-unfriendly characters,
such as spaces,
into a parsable format.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">Percent-encoding</a> employs
UTF-8 encoding,
a common character encoding standard.
Read about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp">UTF-8 percent-encodings</a>
and the characters they correspond to.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="in-case-of-interlibrary-loan"><a class="header" href="#in-case-of-interlibrary-loan">In Case of Interlibrary Loan</a></h3>
<p>We can see another instance of this within <em>Primo</em> itself.
In UK's InfoKat, I search for the phrase <code>electronic resources</code>
and filter by the <em>WorldCat</em> options
from the drop down box to the right of the search box.
By filtering for <em>WorldCat</em> options,
I'm more likely to retrieve records that are
not in UK Library's collections.</p>
<p>The first option is a work titled
<strong>Electronic Resources.
Selection and bibliographic control.</strong>
Since this is not available via UK Libraries,
I would have to request the item
through interlibrary loan.
When I do that, 
the link resolver triggers
<a href="https://support.atlas-sys.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011910073-OpenURL-Configuration">ILLiad</a>,
which is used for interlibrary loan.
Note how the OpenURL looks much different here.
Essentially, the OpenURL is contextual, and
its context reflects the service being used
(i.e., <em>EBSCOhost</em>, <em>ProQuest</em>, <em>Google Scholar</em>,
<em>Primo</em>, <em>Illiad</em>, etc.) which determines
the metadata elements in the URL.
Note that some elements are empty
(e.g., <strong>rft.date=&amp;</strong> is an empty value for the date field 
versus <strong>rft.genre=book&amp;</strong>, which holds the value <strong>book</strong>
for the genre field).</p>

discuss link resolver technology,
migration to new link resolver services, and
methods to evaluate link resolver technology
from both the systems and a user's perspective.
It may not be necessary to learn how to hack
your way through the OpenURL syntax,
as I have above (or below: See Appendix A),
or other aspects of link resolver URL formatting,
but it is a good idea to acquire a basic
understanding of how the URLs work in this process.</p>
<p>Let me re-emphasize that the key way that
link resolvers work is by embedding citation metadata
within the link resolver URL,
including administrative metadata.
This is another reason to have high quality
metadata for our records,
as our readings note.
By implication, if we find,
perhaps by an email from a library patron,
that a link has broken in this process,
it might be that the metadata is incorrect or
has changed in some important way.
Knowing the parts of this process aids us in
deciphering possible errors that exist when the
technology breaks.</p>
<p>For this week, see the <em>ExLibres Alma</em>
link resolver documentation,
which is the link resolver product used by UK Libraries.
Let's discuss this documentation in the forum.
I want you to find and explain other
instances of link resolvers.
Be sure to provide links to these examples and
articulate ways the technology can be evaluated.</p>

<p>Since OpenURL compatible link resolver technology
is partly based on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">query strings</a>
(more on this below),
as we have seen,
we can glean all sorts of information
by examining these URLs:
the query string component that contains
the metadata for the source but
also the base component that
contains the vendor and institutional information
and also the URL type.
When I worked on this section,
I was able to learn that <em>Primo/Alma</em>
uses two URL types to request resources:
a search URL and an OpenURL.
We can see this the URLs.
The base search URL looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?
</code></pre>
<p>The base OpenURL differs just a bit (see the end of the URL):</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?
</code></pre>
<p>The base search URL appears when
searching the university's discovery service.
However, the OpenURL only appears when needed and
during transit between the source and
before reaching the target:
e.g., after clicking on a <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link and
before being redirected to the full text version.
I copied my institution's
specific OpenURL when I clicked on a
<strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link and before it redirected
to the <a href="https://www.openathens.net/">OpenAthens</a> page.</p>
<p>My students often identify great problems to solve
or are the source of great ideas.
In a previous semester,
one of my students in my
electronic resource management class
noticed that <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> has a
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/locate">locate menu</a>
that uses OpenURL resolvers to look up items in a library.
By default, Zotero uses <em>WorldCat</em>, but
it can use a specific institution's OpenURL resolver.
I had completely forgotten about this.
When I investigated whether my institution was listed
in the Zotero locate menu,
I found that it was not nor was it
listed on Zotero's page of
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/locate/openurl_resolvers">OpenURL resolvers</a>.</p>
<p>At the time,
I didn't know what my institution's exact OpenURL was, but
I was able to figure it out by comparing
the syntax and values from other Primo URLs listed on
Zotero's page of OpenURL resolvers.
By comparing these OpenURLs,
I was able to derive my institution's specific OpenURL
(base component plus institutional info), which is:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?institution=01SAA_UKY&amp;vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY
</code></pre>
<p>I added that to Zotero, and it worked, and
then I posted the OpenURL info to Zotero's forum, and
they've added it to their OpenURL resolver page.
If others are curious about how to add this info to Zotero,
<a href="https://library.sacredheart.edu/zotero/advanced/usingLibraryLookup">another library</a>
has created a video on this.
The directions cover adding a specific OpenURL to Zotero
and on how to use Zotero's Library Lookup functionality.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-b"><a class="header" href="#appendix-b">Appendix B</a></h2>
<h3 id="a-basic-url"><a class="header" href="#a-basic-url">A Basic URL</a></h3>
<p>I mentioned query strings above.
Theses are a part of a URL that
include instructions to query
engines, database, or websites
(like <em>Wikipedia</em>).
The parameters (i.e., search terms)
are part of a query string, too.
It's also important to 
understand the base part of a URL (link) because
the <strong>link</strong> in link resolver is the
part of the whole process.
A URL for an  article can looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/10650740510632208/full/html
</code></pre>
<p>This URL contains the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>https:// : indicates the secure hypertext transfer
protocol (HTTP)</li>
<li>www      : indicates the subdomain</li>
<li>emerald  : indicates the second level domain name</li>
<li>.com     : indicates the top level domain</li>
</ul>
<p>Under a standard configuration,
the rest of the URL indicates directory (or folder)
location information on the <em>emerald.com</em> server.
The following suggests
that the article is seven directories (or folders) deep on
the <em>emerald.com</em> server:</p>
<ul>
<li>/insight/content/doi/10.1108/10650740510632208/full/html</li>
</ul>
<p>The DOI (digital object identifier)
for this article is part of the above URL and
is specifically
<code>10.1108/10650740510632208</code>.
The DOI is composed of a <a href="https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html">prefix and a suffix</a>.
The prefix includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 : this is the directory indicator</li>
<li>1108 : the registrant code for this specific journal</li>
</ul>
<p>The suffix refers to the following element:</p>
<ul>
<li>10650740510632208 : a character string (in this case, of
numbers) that refers to the article. This string is
created by the registrant</li>
</ul>
<p>The DOI itself can be used to create a permanent URL
for the above work be adding a <strong>https://doi.org/</strong>
to the beginning:</p>

<h2 id="introduction-6"><a class="header" href="#introduction-6">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><strong>Access</strong> is the paramount
principle of librarianship, and
all other issues,
from censorship to
information retrieval or
to usability,
are on some level derived from or framed
by that principle of <strong>Access</strong>.</p>
<p>This week we devote ourselves
to a discussion of <strong>electronic access</strong>.
To start, let's begin with
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2014.929483">Samples and Healy (2014)</a>,
who provide a nice framework
for thinking about
managing electronic access.
They include two broad categories,
<em>proactive troubleshooting</em> and
<em>reactive troubleshooting</em> of access.</p>
<ul>
<li>proactive troubleshooting of access: &quot;defined as troubleshooting access
problems before they are identified by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;letting public-facing library staff know about planned database
downtime&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;doing a complete inventory to make sure that every database paid for is
in fact 'turned on'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reactive troubleshoot of access: &quot;defined as troubleshooting access issues as
problems are identified and reported by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;fixing broken links&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;fixing incorrect coverage date ranges in the catalog&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;patron education about accessing full text&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal here, as suggested by
Samples and Healy (2014),
is to maximize
proactive troubleshooting and
to minimize reactive troubleshooting.
The Samples and Healy (2014)
report is a great example
of systematic study.
The authors identify a problem that
had grown &quot;organically,&quot;
collected and analyzed data, and
then generalized from it by outlining
a &quot;detailed workflow&quot;
to &quot;improve the timeliness and
accuracy of electronic resource work.&quot;
Practically, studies like
this promise to improve
productivity and work flows
and foster job and
patron satisfaction.
Such studies also help
librarians identify the kinds of
software solutions that align
with their own
workflows and patron
information behaviors.
If interested,
I suggest reading
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2021.1949162">Lowe et al., 2021</a>
about the impact of Covid-19
on electronic resource management.
Six authors individually
describe access issues
at their respective institutions and
show how issues of
pricing, acquisitions, training,
user expectations, and
budgets affect electronic access.
I suggest reading articles
like this in light of the
framework provided
by Samples and Healy (2014)
because stories like these,
about this impact of the
pandemic on electronic access,
can help guide us in
developing proactive troubleshooting
procedures minimize
future issues,
pandemic or otherwise,
at our own institutions.</p>
<p>Samples and Healy (2014)
say something important against a common
assumption about electronic resources,
particularly those provided by vendors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impression that once a resource is acquired, it is then just 'accessible'
belies the actual, shifting nature of electronic resources, where continual
changes in URLs, domain names, or incompatible metadata causes articles and
ebooks to be available one day, but not the next (<em>The Complexity of ERM</em>
section, para. 6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, unlike a printed work
from the long ago print-only era that,
once cataloged,
may be shelved for decades or longer
without major problems of access,
electronic resources require
constant and active attention
to maintain accessibility to them.
Ebooks, for example,
can create metadata problems.
For example,
often what's important
about scholarly ebooks,
in particular,
are the chapters they include, and
hence metadata describing
ebook components is important,
along with providing links to
those chapters in discovery systems.
This difference between
item-level cataloging and
title-level cataloging,
as Samples and Healy describe,
can lead to confusing and problematic
results when considering
different genres
and what those genres contain.</p>
<p>Or, note that they discuss how
a series of links are involved
starting from the source of discovery,
e.g., an OPAC or a discovery layer,
to the retrieved item, and
how difficult it might be in
determining which of these links and
which of those services
is broken when
access becomes problematic.</p>
<p>Let me highlight a few key findings from their report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workflows</strong>: why does this keep coming up? It's because workflows help
automate a process---simplify and smooth out what needs to be done, and
because this is only possible when things are standardized.</li>
<li><strong>Staffing</strong>: we'll discuss this more in another section, but part of the
problem here is that ERM has had a major impact on organizational structure,
but one where different libraries have responded differently. This lack of
organizational standardization has its benefits regarding overall management
practices and cultures, but it also has huge drawbacks---and that's the
difficulty in establishing effective, generalized workflows that include key
participants, and to minimize as many dependencies on any one person.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking</strong>: if there's no tracking, there's no method to systematically
identify patterns in problems. And if that's not possible, then there's no
method to solve those problems proactively. It becomes all reactive
troubleshooting, and reactive troubleshooting, as Samples and Healy indicate,
results in poor patron experiences. We'll discuss tracking when we during the
week on Evaluation and Statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We commonly get the line
that discovery systems are a
great solution
to all the disparate
resources that
librarians subscribe to.
Or, if we do think about
problems with such systems,
we are often presented with a
basic information retrieval problem,
such that the larger the collection to search,
the more likely a relevant
item will get lost in the mix.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2017.1270096">Carter and Traill (2017)</a>
point out that these discovery systems
also tend to reveal
access problems as they are used.
The authors provide a checklist
to help track issues and improve
existing workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5860/lrts.60n1.23">Buhler and Cataldo (2016)</a>
provide an important reminder
that the mission of the
electronic resource librarian
is to serve the patron.
This should remind us that the
internet and the web
have flattened genres.
By that I mean they
have made it difficult
to distinguish among works 
like magazine articles, news articles,
journal articles, encyclopedia articles,
ebooks, etc.
Though the Buhler and Cataldo (2016)
reading is student-focused,
other studies have hinted
at the same issue they describe
across other populations.
It's important,
if possible,
to recognize these issues as
ERM librarians and
work to resolve them
in the ways that you
would be able to.</p>
<p>Myself, I grew up learning about
the differences between
encyclopedia articles, journal articles,
magazine articles, newspaper articles,
book chapters, handbooks,
indexes, and dictionaries
because I grew up with
the print versions,
which by definition,
were tangible things
that looked different from each other.
Today, a traditional first year
college student was born
around the year 2004 and
grew up reading sometime
in the last decade.
The problem this raises is that
although electronic resources
are electronic or digital,
they are still based on genres
that originated in the print age,
yet they lack the
physical characteristics that
distinguished one from the other.
E.g., what's the difference
between a longer
<em>NY Times</em> article
(traditionally a newspaper article) and
an article in the <em>New Yorker</em>
(traditionally a magazine article) today
in their online forms?
Aside from some aesthetic differences
between the two,
they are both presented on web pages,
and it's not altogether obvious,
based on any kind of cursory examination,
that we can tell,
as regular users,
that they're entirely different genres.
However, there are important
informational differences between the two,
how they were written,
how they were edited,
how long they are,
and who they were written by
that might still lead us to
consider them as different genres.
Even <em>Wikipedia</em> articles pose this problem.
Citing an encyclopedia article was
never an accepted practice,
but this was only true
for general encyclopedias.
It was generally okay
to cite articles from
special encyclopedias because
they focused on limited subject matters
like art, music, science, culture, and
were usually more in-depth in their coverage.
Examples include the
<em>Encyclopedia of GIS</em>,
the <em>Encyclopedia of Evolution</em>,
<em>The Kentucky African American Encyclopedia</em>,
<em>The Encyclopedia of Virtual Art Carving Toraja--Indonesia</em>,
and so forth.
There are studies that show that
<em>Wikipedia</em> provides the same
kind of in-depth coverage
of some special encyclopedias,
thus helping
to flatten the encyclopedia genre, too.</p>
<p>The flattening holds
true for things like <em>Google</em>.
The best print analogy for <em>Google</em>
is that of an index,
which was used to locate
keywords that would
<em>refer</em> to source material.
The main difference
between these indexes and <em>Google</em>
is that the indexes were
produced to cover specific publications,
like a newspaper,
or specific areas,
like the <em>Social Science Citation Index</em> or
the <em>Science Citation Index</em>,
both of which are
actual, documented, historical precursors
to <em>Google</em> and to <em>Google Scholar</em>.
But today, these search engines
are erroneously considered source material
(e.g, &quot;I found it on Google&quot;).
Few, I think, would have considered
a print index as source material,
but rather as a <strong>reference</strong> item,
since it <em>referred</em> users to sources.
Nowadays, it's all mixed up,
but who can blame anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Example print indexes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6wqu02M7OQzyJnCG2">Photos of the New York Times Index</a></li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JpnqxzZ44dhM06cq2">Photos of the Newspaper Index for the Washington Post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Y5ronALog63zIxwr1">Photos of the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="access-and-authentication"><a class="header" href="#access-and-authentication">Access and Authentication</a></h2>
<p>In this section,
we'll delve into the technological frameworks that
facilitate access to and authentication of library electronic collections.
Given that a significant portion
of these resources are behind paywalls,
libraries employ specialized software
to verify user credentials before granting access.
These authentication measures are not just best practices
but are often mandated by contractual agreements with content providers.</p>
<p>There are two main technologies
used to authenticate users.
The first is through an IP / proxy server, and
the second is through what is called SAML authentication.
We address these two authentication types below.</p>
<h3 id="proxy-authentication"><a class="header" href="#proxy-authentication">Proxy Authentication</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html">EZproxy</a> (OCLC)
is the main 
product of the first type.
When we access any paywalled work,
like a journal article,
you may notice something like
<strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong>
in the string of text in a URL.
For example,
the following is an EZProxy URL:</p>
<pre><code>https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/science/article/pii/S030645730500004X
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that UK Libraries, which I use in these examples, is transitioning away
from EZProxy and adopting OpenAthens, which is SAML based. More on that
below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing about
this URL is that it has a
<strong>uky.edu</strong> address even
though the article is in
a journal that's
hosted in Elsevier's
<em>ScienceDirect</em> database.
The <strong>www-sciencedirect-com</strong>
part of the address is
a simple subdomain of
<strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong>
(you can tell because
the components are separated
by dashes instead of periods),
As a subdomain,
it is no different than
the <strong>www</strong> in <strong>www.google.com</strong> or
the <strong>maps</strong> in <strong>maps.google.com</strong>.
The original URL is
in fact:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645730500004X
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to the first URL,
the interesting thing about
the original URL is that it
is in fact a 
<strong>sciencedirect.com</strong> address.
Even though &quot;sciencedirect&quot;
appears in the <strong>uky.edu</strong> URL,
it is not a &quot;sciencedirect.com&quot; server.
They are two different servers,
from two different organizations,
and are as different as
<strong>uky.edu</strong> and <strong>google.com</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason we read an article
or some other paywalled content
at a <strong>uky.edu</strong> address and not
at a, e.g.,
<strong>sciencedirect.com</strong> address
is because of the way
proxy servers work.
In essence,
when we make a request for
a resource,
like a journal article or
a bibliographic database,
that's provided by a library,
our browser makes the request
to the proxy server and not
to the original server.
The proxy server then
makes the resource request
to the original server,
which relays that content
back to the proxy server (EZproxy),
which then sends 
the content to our browser.
This means that when we request
an article in a journal
at sciencedirect.com or jstor.com,
our browser never actually makes
a connection to those servers.
Instead, the proxy server
acts as a go-between.
See <a href="https://libtechlaunchpad.com/2017/04/25/proxy-servers-basics-and-resources/">Day (2017)</a>
for a more technical
and yet accessible
description of the process.</p>
<p>Proxy servers provide access
either through a login server
or based on the user's IP address.
If we're on campus,
then our authentication is
IP based,
since all devices attached
to the university's network
are assigned an IP
from a pre-defined
range of IP addresses.
This makes access to paywalled
content fairly seamless,
when on campus.</p>
<p>If we are off-campus,
access is authenticated
via a login method to
the proxy server.
When we attempt to access
paywalled content from off-campus,
we will see an EZproxy login URL.
This looks something like this
for accessing the
<em>ScienceDirect</em> database:</p>
<pre><code>http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://www.sciencedirect.com
</code></pre>
<p>Aside from <em>ScienceDirect</em>,
you can see a list of other
subscribed content that requires
EZproxy authentication here:</p>
<pre><code>https://login.ezproxy.uky.edu/menu
</code></pre>
<h3 id="saml-authentication"><a class="header" href="#saml-authentication">SAML Authentication</a></h3>
<p>The second main technology
used to authenticate and
provide access
is based on what is
called SAML authentication.
The main product that provides
SAML authentication for libraries is
<a href="https://www.openathens.net/">OpenAthens</a>.</p>
<p>SAML, or
<em>Security Assertion Markup Language</em>,
is an XML-based standard that
exchanges and authorizes data between parties,
in particular,
between an identity provider (IdP) and
a service provider (SP).</p>
<p>Unlike a proxy / IP
authentication process,
SAML's main function is that of a
identity verification system.
Under this method,
libraries offer a single sign-on process,
and once authenticated,
patrons have access to all SAML ready
content or service providers.
The process is similar to
the <a href="https://duo.com/docs/sso-generic">Duo Single Sign-On</a>
service many universities
use for authentication.
In the OpenAthens case,
users are authenticated via
an identity provider,
which would be the library
or the broader institution
(and usually via some other software service).
The library provides identification
by connecting to its organization's
identity management system,
such as <em>adfs</em>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services">Active Directory Federation Services</a>.
Once a patron has been authenticated,
a confirmation is sent to the
content provider, which
then provides access to
the content to the patron.
For more details,
see <a href="https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml">What is SAML?</a> and
this detailed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o4syOJsIf0">OpenAthens software demo</a>.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of this method
is that URLs are not proxied,
which means that content is not
delivered to the patron
from a proxy server like EZproxy.
Instead, patrons access the
original source directly.
From a patron's perspective,
this facilitese sharing clean, unproxied URLs.
As far as I can tell,
one of the downsides might
be privacy related.
With a proxy server,
users don't access the
original source, but
instead the source is delivered
through the proxy server,
which by definition,
masks the patron's IP address
and browser information.
This wouldn't be true under
the SAML method.</p>
<p>In a bit more detail,
a SAML-based authentication process
is described below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User Request</strong>: A user tries to access a resource on the service provider (e.g., a paywalled library article).</li>
<li><strong>Redirection</strong>: If the user is not already authenticated, the service provider redirects the user to the identity provider (IdP), often passing along a SAML request.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: The IdP challenges the user to provide valid credentials (e.g., username and password). If the user is already authenticated with the IdP (e.g., already logged into a university portal), this step may be skipped.</li>
<li><strong>Assertion Creation</strong>: Upon successful authentication, the IdP generates a SAML assertion, which is an XML document that includes the user's authorization information.</li>
<li><strong>Response</strong>: The IdP sends this SAML assertion back to the service provider, often as part of a SAML response package.</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: The service provider verifies the SAML assertion (often by checking a digital signature) to ensure it came from a trusted IdP.</li>
<li><strong>Access Granted</strong>: Once the assertion is verified, the service provider grants the user access to the requested resource.</li>
<li><strong>Session</strong>: A session is established for the user, allowing them to access other resources without needing to re-authenticate for a certain period.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the context of a library,
the IdP could be a university's authentication system,
and the service provider could be a database of academic journals.
When a student tries to access an article,
they would be redirected to log in through the university's system.
Once authenticated,
the university's system would send a
SAML assertion to the journal database,
confirming that the student is authorized to access the content.</p>
<p>This method is particularly useful for organizations
like universities that have multiple service providers
(e.g., different databases, internal services, etc.)
but want to offer a single sign-on (SSO) experience for their users.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-3"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-3">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The Samples &amp; Healy (2014) and
the Carter &amp; Traill (2017) articles
address troubleshooting strategies 
with electronic resources.
One additional thing to note
about these readings is
how the organizational structure
influences workflows and how
the continued transition from
a print-era model of library processes
to an electronic one remains problematic.
Even once that transition is complete,
both readings make the case that
strategy and preparation are
needed to deal with these issues.
The Buhler &amp; Cataldo (2016) article
shows how confusing e-resources
are to patrons and
how the move to digital has
complicated all genres,
or &quot;containers&quot;, as
the authors name them.
Such &quot;ambiguity&quot; has
implications not only for
how users find and identify
electronic resources but
on how librarians manage
access to them.</p>
<p>I added the
EZproxy and OpenAthens
content in order to complete
the technical discussions we
have had in recent weeks on
integrated library systems, 
electronic resource management systems,
link resolvers,
and standards.
These authentication and access
technologies complete these discussions,
which, altogether,
cover the major technologies
that electronic resource librarians
work with to provide access
to paywalled content in library
collections.
Both technologies aim to
provide seamless access to
paywalled content, as
nearly as seamless as accessing
content via a search engine or
other source.
Although neither will never be
able to offer completely seamless
access as long there are paywalled
sources in library collections,
the job of an electronic resource
librarian is often to make sure
they work as well as possible.
This will often mean working 
with vendors and colleagues.</p>

<p>This chapter on e-resource stewardship explores the complex and essential
aspects of managing electronic resources within libraries. The following
sections cover: 1. the ERM workflow, which details the procedures and practices
involved in the effective handling of digital materials; 2. markets and
economics of e-resources, which offers insights into how copyright law
influences the financial dynamics and market trends that shape electronic
resource availability and pricing; 3. licensing, which focuses on the legal
considerations and contractual agreements essential to obtaining and providing
electronic content; 4. negotiations for e-resources, which examines the
strategies and techniques employed in securing favorable terms and conditions
for libraries and their patrons; and 5. acquisitions and collection
development, which helps illuminate the careful planning and execution involved
in curating a diverse and relevant digital collection. The goal with sections
is to provide a holistic view of e-resource stewardship, equipping readers with
the knowledge and skills necessary for the contemporary electronic resource
landscape.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-7"><a class="header" href="#introduction-7">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>If all goes according to plan,
this week's readings
on electronic resource management and
on workflow analysis should
put prior material into context and
act as a bridge to the material
we discuss in the
remaining sections of this work. </p>
<p>To recap: in the beginning
we learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>what it means to be a librarian who oversees or is a part of electronic
resource management,</li>
<li>what kinds of criteria are sought for in new hires, and</li>
<li>why electronic resources have introduced so much <em>constant disruption</em> across
libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>This latter point is largely
due to, among other things,
the fact that the
print-era involved largely
(or at least more so)
a linear process of
collection management
and information use
that was fundamentally altered
with the introduction of
electronic resources.</p>
<p>Then we learned
about the functions and
modules offered by:</p>
<ul>
<li>electronic resource management software and</li>
<li>integrated library system software. </li>
</ul>
<p>To understand those
systems better,
we learned about
standards, technical reports,
and recommended best practices
by studying documents
prepared by NISO and 
its members, and
component technologies
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenURL link resolvers</li>
<li>Access and authentication technologies:
<ul>
<li>EZProxy</li>
<li>OpenAthens</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical and workflow standards</li>
</ul>
<p>And we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>why standards are important, whether they are technical or address workflows,</li>
<li>why interoperability is required, and</li>
<li>what happens when access to electronic resources break.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="readings-3"><a class="header" href="#readings-3">Readings</a></h2>
<p>This week things will start
to make connections
at a faster pace.
In the first
<a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4492/5257">Anderson article (chapter 2)</a>,
we gain a clearer idea
of what a knowledge base is and
how it works.
We learn more about
how integrated library systems and
ERM systems work together (or fail to).
We dip our toes
into newer topics
like licensing, COUNTER, and SUSHI,
which we'll cover in
greater detail towards
the end of this work.</p>
<p>In the second
<a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4493/5259">Anderson article (chapter 3)</a>,
we learn how to 
carefully consider a
library's work flow before
selecting which ERM
software to purchase.
(This is why workflow-based
standards are important,
even if they are
not true technical standards.)
We do this because
we select systems
based on the needs
of the librarians,
which may be vastly
different across libraries, and
which must rely on different
aspects of the overall process.
As you read this chapter,
keep in mind
the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2014.929483">Samples and Healy</a>
article from the
previous section and the
discussions of proactive versus
reactive troubleshooting.</p>
<p>As hinted at in these readings,
especially in the
section on acquisitions,
budgets, subscriptions, and
purchasing in Anderson's paper on the
<a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4492/5257">Elements of Electronic Resource Management</a>,
and in the
multiple discussions about
the role vendors play
in electronic resource management,
the market and the economics
of this area of
librarianship weigh heavily
on everyday realities.
We will follow up on
this in the next section when we
begin to read more about
the market and the economics
of electronic resources.
For example,
in both Anderson
readings,
we learn about the
CORE recommended practice (RP), or the
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/core-cost-resource-exchange">Cost of Resource Exchange</a>,
that was developed by NISO.
CORE brings together
three aspects of our
previous discussions:
software, funds, and interoperability.
Here the <em>CORE RP</em> describes
how the ILS and ERM systems
can communicate the
costs of electronic resources
between each other.
Its existence hints at
the pressures librarians
have had in having
to deal with
complex budget issues.
Although these articles were
published before the pandemic,
the pandemic has made these issues more
complicated for libraries.</p>
<p>While we spent time
discussing technical standards,
we also learned about <a href="http://6terms.tumblr.com/">TERMS</a>,
an attempt to standardize
the language and processes
involved with
electronic resource management.
We see more connections
in this week's readings.
Aside from the CORE standard,
we learn about
standardizing attempts at licensing,
which includes the <em>COUNTER</em> and <em>SUSHI</em>
usage-related standards
that outline the
communication, collection, presentation, and
the formatting of usage statistics
for electronic resources
such as ebooks,
journals, databases, and more.</p>
<p>We have discussed interoperability and
what it takes for
multiple systems to
connect and transfer content
between each other.
We primarily discussed this with
respect to link resolver technology,
and we did this not just
because we should know about
link resolvers as important
components of
electronic resource management, but
also because link resolvers
are a good example
of the kind of work
that is involved for
systems to communicate properly.
There are other forms of
interoperability, though, and
coming back to
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/core-cost-resource-exchange">CORE</a> again,
the <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4493/5259">Anderson article (chapter 2)</a>
provides a link to a
<a href="https://old.diglib.org/standards/ERMI_Interop_Report_20080108.pdf">white paper</a>
on the interoperability
of acquisitions modules between 
integrated library systems and
electronic resource management systems.
This paper defines 
13 data elements that were
determined to be desired in
any exchange between
ILS software and ERM software
for these software to
communicate usefully
with each other.
By that, I mean, the
data points enable meaningful
use of both the ILS software and
the ERM software, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>purchase order number</li>
<li>price</li>
<li>start/end dates</li>
<li>vendor</li>
<li>vendor ID</li>
<li>invoice number</li>
<li>fund code</li>
<li>invoice date</li>
<li>selector</li>
<li>vendor contact information</li>
<li>purchase order note</li>
<li>line item note</li>
<li>invoice note (Medeiros, 2008).</li>
</ul>
<p>That white paper contains
example and worthwhile
use cases and
stories from major libraries, and
these cases are
rather helpful reads.
This paper is well worth
reading to get
a sense of how standards
are created through a
process of comparing,
contrasting, and coordinating needs and
contexts among different entities.</p>
<p>These Anderson readings are
great because they illustrate
the whole ERM process.
If you are able,
visit the journal issue
for these two readings
and read the
other chapters that
Anderson has written,
but in particular, the
<a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4491/5255">Electronic Resource Management Systems and Related Products</a>.</p>
<p>In short,
this section's topic 
provides a foundation
for the remaining topics 
we study.
In particular, 
they will help frame what
we learn when we study
the markets and economics
of the electronic resource industry,
the process of licensing and negotiation, and
about the evaluation and statistics of usage.
Think of this section 
as a foundation and as a
transition between
all we have studied thus far,
and what we study going forward.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-8"><a class="header" href="#introduction-8">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I think it's fair to claim
that current copyright laws
heavily influence the price
of electronic resources, and
in this section,
we cover the basics of copyright,
how copyright creates monopolies, and
how those monopolies,
in the digital era, are
able to demand substantial sums of 
money for electronic resources, and
finally, how this impacts
library budgets.</p>
<p>Below I'll discuss copyright and
the first sale doctrine,
I show how digital works
have disrupted some basic
ways that libraries function.
Then I'll discuss the impact
that this law has on complicated
e-resource collections and costs.</p>
<h3 id="copyright"><a class="header" href="#copyright">Copyright</a></h3>
<p>Copyright law grants a monopoly
to the person or corporate owner
of an intellectual property.
That is, copyright owners have
exclusive rights over the material
that they own,
where the owners may be
a person or an organizational entity.
Section 106 of the law grants
copyright owners the following rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;</p>
<p>(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;</p>
<p>(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;</p>
<p>(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the
copyrighted work publicly;</p>
<p>(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the
individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display
the copyrighted work publicly; and</p>
<p>(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly
by means of a digital audio transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106">Copyright Section 106</a></p>
<p>These exclusive and all-encompassing
rights are designed to allow
copyright owners a monopoly
of their property.
While it is good to incentivize
the creation of intellectual property,
without restrictions,
there would be little to no
benefit to the public.
For example,
if those exclusive rights
were followed without limitation,
then it would mean that the
exchange of money
for a work between a
copyright holder and a buyer
for something like a
printed book or a DVD
would not entail a transfer
of ownership of that physical copy;
that is, it would not allow
the buyer of the physical item
any distribution rights
of the item once the
first exchange has been made.
Under such a scenario,
libraries would be able to buy physical
books but would not be able to lend them.</p>
<p>To address this,
the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#109">First Sale Doctrine</a>
(also see the
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1854-copyright-infringement-first-sale-doctrine">Justice Department's explanation</a>)
helps avoid the issue granted by the
list of exclusive rights
listed in Section 106.
Because of the first sale doctrine,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbs-Merrill_Co._v._Straus">made precedent in the early 20th century</a> and
then <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/">codified into law in 1976</a>,
you, I, or a library
may buy a physical copy of a work,
like a book, a DVD, a painting, and
literally own that specific copy.
First sale doctrine does not
grant us reproduction rights,
as listed in
<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106">Section 106</a>
of the 1976 copyright law, but
it does allow us to distribute
the singular, physical representation or
embodiment of the work
that we have purchased.
Thus, the first sale doctrine
is why libraries were able to thrive
throughout the 20th century,
lend material, and preserve it.
More mundanely, it's also why
I can buy a book at a bookstore and
later give it away or sell it to someone. </p>
<p>The digital medium
makes things messier,
as it tends to do.
There are two big reasons for this.
First, digital works are not
subject to the same distribution
constraints as physical works are, and
the first sale doctrine is
about distribution rights and
not reproduction rights.
If I have a physical copy of
some book and give you
my copy of that book,
then I no longer have that copy.
However, if I have a copy
of a digital file, then
as we all know,
it is relatively
trivial to share that file
with you without losing
access to my own copy.
Since digital works
can be copied and distributed without
losing access to the copies or
to the original,
the First Sale Doctrine does not
necessarily apply
to digital copies.
Consequently,
in the digital space,
there are fewer limitations on supply,
including on lending.</p>
<p>Second, many digital works
are like software,
or at least,
they are intertwined
with the software and hardware needed
to display them.
This is true for all kinds of documents,
like HTML pages,
which need a web browser or
a text editor to read them;
or audio files,
which need a media player
to listen to them.
But consider ebooks as an example.
Whether a printed book is
the size of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto">quarto</a>
or as large as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio">folio</a>,
whether it is all text,
whether it includes images,
or whether it has pop-ups
makes no difference to its
basic distribution potential and
ergo its copyright status.
These physical works are,
in essence,
self-contained.
Ebooks, however, arrive in
all shapes and sizes.
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>
distributes public domain ebooks in 
various file formats
that include plain text documents,
that have no presentation markup
like bold, italics, and like,
HTML documents with markup,
XML documents like EPUB, and
then also PDFs and others.
Why so many file formats?
Text is text, right?
In the print space,
a book is simply text
printed on pages of paper,
even if it is sometimes printed
on different sized pages or
using different type settings.
But these various markups
exist because they each offer
technological or presentational advantages and
are often tied to specific
pieces of software and hardware.</p>
<p>This is especially true
for proprietary, encrypted file formats,
like the ones that Amazon created
for use only on Kindles
(other e-reader and other stores also), or
the popular MP3 file format for
audio recordings that only recently
became patent free.
While file formats like these
may not be necessarily counted as software,
depending on how we define software,
it is certainly true that file formats
and the specific software applications
that display or play them
are intertwined.
If you are old enough,
you may remember the
headaches caused with files created
as <strong>.doc</strong> in some early version
of Microsoft Word that later failed
to display properly in a
future Microsoft Word version or
in some other word document software
or on some other operating system.
WordPerfect 5.1 was a
popular word processing applications
in the 1990s, and
it's not clear if files
created with that application,
or other popular word processing
applications at that time,
would open today,
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/wptoword.html">at least without intervention</a>.
In short, these complexities
introduce obstacles
to the first sale doctrine and
raise other copyright issues
because of the
connection to software,
which is also often copyrighted.</p>
<p>The main idea here, though,
is that copyright holders and
publishers have
little financial interest in
selling actual digital
copies of works
since they cannot prevent
future distribution without
special technologies.
Instead, they are motivated
to license material,
and retain ownership, and
sometimes explicitly tie that material
to specific pieces of
software and hardware,
like the Kindle,
which would have to be bought.
That, we should note,
adds additional expense.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-ebook-collections"><a class="header" href="#impact-on-ebook-collections">Impact on Ebook Collections</a></h2>
<p>What does this mean for
libraries in the digital age?
It means that libraries buy less and
rent or license more, and
renting means that
they continually pay for
something for as long as they
want access to it.
As <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/5833">Sanchez (2015)</a> puts it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At its simplest, this takes the form of paying x dollars per year per title
during the length of the contract (Forecasting sect, para 4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the total supply of
works increases, e.g.,
the total number of published
books increase,
as they do each year,
then it means renting more and
more without ever
completely acquiring.
(It also means, holding collections
at a stable number,
providing access to less.)
When budgets are cut or
remain stagnant,
this ultimately entails
a decline in the collection a
library has to offer,
or if not a decline in the collection,
then cuts in some other areas of a library,
like the number of librarians
or other staff.
This is the conundrum
that Sanchez raises in his article.</p>
<p>If that alone were the issue,
maybe librarians could
discern other sustainable
ways to proceed, but
Sanchez (2015) raises additional
issues and questions:
what if publishers raise the
prices for digital content
at an annual rate faster than
what they already raise for
print content (reasonable assumption)?
If so, does that mean that
librarians will be able
to afford fewer titles,
digital or print,
unless they raise their budgets, and,
as they weed,
how would that impact the
physical space of the library?
(See figure 2.3, specifically,
from Sanchez's article.
The plot shows just how
much could be lost and
how little gained if
the forecasts Sanchez
discusses come true.)</p>
<p>There are many ways
to put constraints on the supply
of an item in the digital landscape,
as opposed to limiting supply
in the physical space,
which involve fewer methods.
That is, it's relatively easy for
publishers and others to
restrict the supply of physical works.
They simply have to limit how
many of those physical works are
manufactured
(e.g., the number of print runs).
But given the nature of digital content,
restricting supply is driven by
the technologies available to do so,
and since there are so many
publishers and distribution points,
then each one of these points will
often create their own unique type of
constraint on the supply.
The result is that there will
be a number of confusing methods
implemented to limit constraint,
even if these limitations
are marketed as selling points.
In practice,
this may mean that only a limited
number of people may &quot;check&quot;
out a work from a library at one time,
or access a database at one time, and
so forth.
Thus, the budget issue has
an impact on access and usability.</p>
<p>There have been recent attempts
to address these issues.
<a href="https://www.charleston-hub.com/2022/07/legally-speaking-states-unsuccessful-in-providing-financial-relief-of-ebook-terms-for-libraries/">Paganelli (2022)</a> describes
some state by state efforts to
lessen the financial burdens on libraries
that e-content entails.
However, as Paganelli notes,
these efforts have largely
not succeeded.
From a publisher's perspective,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12109-022-09880-7">Sisto (2022)</a>
argues that the general
narrative about the tension between
libraries and publishers is misleading.
Instead, the author argues,
the landscape is much more complex, and
the publishers have made a number
of attempts to &quot;make their e-lending
policies better for librarians&quot;
(2018-2019: Policy Updates and
Different Opinions sect, para 6).
Personally, I'm not sure I buy
(or lease) many of Sisto's arguments,
but I think one thing is clear:
the e-lending market is complex and
miscommunication abounds.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-ejournal-collections"><a class="header" href="#impact-on-ejournal-collections">Impact on eJournal Collections</a></h2>
<p>Although ebooks likely represent
the biggest impact on
public library budgets,
academic libraries are largely
concerned with scholarly journals.
Like Sanchez (2015),
<a href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/death-1000-cuts-periodicals-price-survey-2018">Bosch, Albee, &amp; Henderson (2018)</a>
show that the major issue
is that academic library
budgets are declining or
holding flat
even though prices continue to
increase for journal titles and
even though the number of
published articles increase.
This raises an interesting phenomenon:
although researchers are
hurt by the lack of access to research,
researchers are also part of the
cause of the supply.</p>
<p>The authors also note that
part of the drive to publish
includes a drive to publish in
so-called <em>prestigious</em> journal
titles, where <em>prestigious</em> is
determined by how well cited the
title is.
The authors refer to a
few citation-based metrics that
the research community uses to
determine prestige.
These include
the long-established <em>Impact Factor</em>,
which can be examined in
the <em>Journal Citation Reports</em>
(JCR) provided by Clarivate Analytics,
as well as newer ones,
such as the <em>Eigenfactor</em> and
the <em>Article Influence Score</em>,
which can also be examined in
JCR (the eigenfactor.org site is
not well updated, at the time of
this writing).</p>
<p>One motivation for using a
citation metric as the basis
of evaluating journal titles is
because citation metrics indicate,
at some level, the use of the work.
That is, a citation to
an article in a journal title
means, ideally, that the authors
citing that article have read the article
and use the knowledge from that work
to add new knowledge.
Historically, when Eugene
Garfield invented the <em>Impact Factor</em>,
it was partly so as a
tool for librarians to use in
collection management because he
recognized this use-based theory
of citations.</p>
<p>However, citation metrics should
never be the sole or even primary
tool to evaluate research, though.
While they may provide good
information, there are many caveats.
First, there are different
fields of research,
and some fields cite at different
rates and at different volumes
than other fields, and also for
different reasons.
This is why,
in Table 5 of the
Bosch, Albee, and Henderson (2018)
article, the cost per cite for journals
in the Philosophy &amp; Religion
category are so much higher that
the cost per cite of titles in
other categories.
Authors in P&amp;R simply have different
citation and publishing behaviors
than authors in other categories.
Second, citations do not capture
all uses of a journal.
For example, there are many journal
titles that I might use in my
courses but may not use in my research,
and this is true for other faculty,
yet citation metrics won't reflect
that kind of use.
The authors refer to <em>altmetrics</em>,
which was invented to help capture
additional non-citing uses of
scholarly products, but altmetrics
is still in its infancy and is
largely dependent on data sources
and scholarly behavior that are
problematic themselves.
Third, there are various issues with
the metrics themselves.
The <em>Impact Factor</em> is based on an
outdated calculation and is thus
not a very appropriate statistical
measure.
The other metrics 
were created to address that but
may have other problems.
And four, the use of the metrics,
regardless of which one, tends to
drive publishing behavior---such
that journal titles with higher
metrics tend to attract more
submissions and more attention,
thus driving more citations
to them.
Such skewing drives demand
to publish in those journals.
Thus, citation based metrics are
comparable to a kind
of capitalist economic system
where, as the sociologist of
science Robert Merton noted,
<a href="http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthew1.pdf">the richer get richer (in
citations) and the poor get
poorer</a>.
The issue then is that prestige,
defined in this way,
does not necessarily indicate quality:
just use.</p>
<p>The authors also discuss some
issues with <em>Gold Open Access</em> and
the idea that Gold OA may compound
the cost problem.
This is where authors
pay a publication fee,
or an article processing charge
(APC), once a manuscript has
been accepted by a
journal (there are other types of
Gold OA cost models).
We can do a quick off the cuff
and rough calculation to see why this
might compound the problem.
As an example,
<em>PLOS ONE</em> is one of the largest
gold OA journals
and charges an
<a href="https://www.plos.org/publication-fees">APC of $1,805 USD</a>
(that's $110 more than it was in 2021 and
$210 more than it was in 2020, when
I wrote the first draft of this section).
In 2018, 32 papers were published in
PLOS ONE that included at least
one author from the University
of Kentucky, totaling $51,040 in
APCs for the 50 total institutions
that were associated with these papers.
This amounts to about $1020
per institution, in 2018 dollars,
paid for by the authors and not
libraries.
For UK authors, this also amounts
to over $32,640 spent on APCs
(32 * $1020).
This is about $27K more than
the average price of the most expensive
category, Chemistry, as reported
in Table 1 of the reading.
So even if open access reduced
costs to libraries,
it still may not reduce cost
on taxpayers at large,
which are who fund much of
publishing much of this research.</p>

issued by The White House
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/">Office of Science and Technology Policy</a>
might make things more <em>interesting</em>.
The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">OSTP memorandum</a> states that
&quot;federally funded research must be
publicly accessible without an embargo
on their free and public release.&quot;
This mandate requires that federal
agencies with research and development
expenditures to develop their own policies,
and that could mean that such policies
result in Gold OA agency-specific mandates
or Green OA mandates.
Green OA means allows pre-prints
be made available (article versions 
before peer-review) or
post-prints (article versions after
peer-review) but not publisher versions
(versions after formatting, etc.).
We'll see how this plays out.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-9"><a class="header" href="#introduction-9">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I think it's fair to say
that what characterizes
electronic resource management the most
is licensing.
For if something is licensed,
then it's most likely e-content or related,
and by definition, it's not owned by a library,
and thus it's a <em>temporary</em> item in the collection,
and thus requires special management.</p>
<p>Licensing requires understanding other
aspects of electronic resource management, too.
While an ERM librarian's job duties might
be solely focused on the technical aspects
of the work,
i.e., those things we covered in prior sections,
an ERM librarian whose primary job
duty is to participate in the
licensing process must have a good grasp
of the technical for no reason
other than that it is the technical
that is licensed.
In other words,
it's probably a good thing
to understand what is being licensed.
Thus, this is an area of ERM librarianship
that might take time to work up to.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though,
we should refresh ourselves
on the basics of copyright law,
since what is being licensed is a
fact of its existence.
We should also know something about
contract law, and
how the two types of laws are related,
since licensing entails negotiating,
signing, and managing contracts.</p>
<h2 id="copyright-and-contracts"><a class="header" href="#copyright-and-contracts">Copyright and Contracts</a></h2>
<p>There is a complicated tension 
between <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/">copyright law</a> and
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contract">contract law</a>.
In short, copyright is
a temporary <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/"><em>right</em></a> because
of its close connection to the concept
of the <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/">public domain</a>.
In the US, copyright was established in
the Constitution under
<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C8-1/ALDE_00013060/">Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8</a>,
which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The Congress shall have Power ...] To
promote the Progress of Science and useful
Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors
and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
respective Writings and Discoveries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reading of this has been,
and note, this is my reading and
not necessarily legal dogma,
that <em>respective Writings and Discoveries</em>
belong to the public;
as such, this clause was articulated
in the Constitution
to carve out some protection space
for the authors or inventors
from the public,
for <em>a limited time</em>,
in order to <em>promote
the Progress of Science and useful Arts</em>.
But in the end,
it is the public that is served
and that ultimately owns these creations.</p>
<p>The clause gives copyright owners
a <em>right</em>, and as a right,
it takes preemptive status
over other laws that are
less universal,
laws that are <em>in personam</em> (Rub, 2017).
On the other hand,
what creates tension is that
it is a kind of <em>right</em> that can
be transferred or sold by way of a contract;
that is, it is <em>in personam</em>.
Under this view,
copyrighted work is property (Rub, 2017),
and as property,
it can be traded for goods
and services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>in personam</em>: made against or affecting
a specific person only;
imposing a personal liability (Google Dictionary).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, copyright exists in a unique space
where it functions as a basic right,
embedded in the earliest part of the
US Constitution;
it exists as a temporary bulwark
against public ownership for
the public good;
and unlike other, basic rights,
copyright is transferable,
much like property is transferable.</p>
<p>This all gets more complicated when
licensing enters the picture, and
this largely has to do with three things.
First, the history of software
reflects the history of print,
in as much as source code relied
on a physical medium,
like a floppy disk or magnetic tape,
to be distributed,
just as a book had to be printed
to be distributed.
Second, the internet and greater
availability of higher bandwidth speeds
enabled, like books, software to
be distributed as easily as any
other digital object.
Third, it wasn't originally
clear that software, or source code
in particular, was copyrightable,
but the Copyright Office at the
Library of Congress eventually
decided that it was eligible.
This elibility became codified
in an 1980 amendment to
the 1976 Copyright Act.
This cemented the ability for 
software copyright owners to lease
their source code,
especially once that code was
free of a physical expression,
and thereby evade the First Sale Doctrine,
to users without transferring ownership
of the expression to users.</p>

<h2 id="licensing-agreements"><a class="header" href="#licensing-agreements">Licensing Agreements</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.esports.law/blog/licensing-agreements-components-and-concerns">Licensing agreements</a>
offer copyright or intellectual property
(patents, trademarks)
owners a contractual framework.
This framework functions as an
agreement among two or more parties.
It enables the parties involved
to participate,
within some range of time
(all contracts must have
start and end dates),
in an owner's intellectual property
under certain conditions.
Librarians enter into licensing
agreements of all sorts.
Licences cover bibliographic databases,
ILS/ERM software, and
of course, e-content.</p>
<p>Entering a licensing agreement for
e-content means that libraries
do not own that content but
only have access for a limited period of time,
as defined in the contract.
This is unlike print works,
which fall under the first-sale doctrine.
The existence of a licensing agreement
between a library and an
intellectual property owner
thus entails lack of
ownership of the <em>item</em>
(think of item as defined by the
<em>Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records</em>
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/cds/downloads/FRBR.PDF">FRBR</a> model).</p>
<h2 id="licenses"><a class="header" href="#licenses">Licenses</a></h2>
<p>Weir (2016) provides a nice outline
of licenses and what they include.
According to Weir,
there are two general types
of licensing agreements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End user agreements</strong>: these are generally the kind that people
accept when they use some kind of software or some service.</li>
<li><strong>Site agreements</strong>: these are the agreements librarians get involved
in when they negotiate for things like databases. Here, <em>site</em> refers
to the organizational entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Licenses must include a variety of components.
Weir (2016) outlines the parts
of a standard license.
They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introductions</strong>: this includes information about the licensee and
the licensor, date information, some information about payments and
the schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong>: this section defines the major terms of the contract.
Weir includes, as examples, the licensee, the licensor, authorized
user, user population, and whether the contract entails a single or
multi-user site.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong>: This covers topics such as IP authentication and proxy
access.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable use</strong>: Included here are issues related to downloading,
storage, print rights, interlibrary loan (ILL), and preservation.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited use</strong>: What people cannot do: download restrictions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: What the licensee's (the library)
responsibilities are. Be careful about accepting responsibility for
actions that the library would have a difficult time monitoring. Then
also, what are the licensor's responsibilities. This might include
topics such as 24 hour access.</li>
<li><strong>Term and terminations</strong>: Details about the terms of the contract and
how the contract may be terminated. Be aware that many libraries are
attached to either municipal, county, or state governments and must
adhere to relevant laws.</li>
<li>Various provisions</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example,
the California Digital Library,
via the University of California,
provides a <a href="https://cdlib.org/resources/vendors/license-agreement-checklist/">checklist</a>
and a copy of their
standard license agreement.</p>
<p>The checklist covers four
main sections, additional subsections,
and is well worth a read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content and Access</li>
<li>Licensing</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Management</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="standardizing-agreements"><a class="header" href="#standardizing-agreements">Standardizing Agreements</a></h2>
<p>Like the various technologies that
we have covered,
NISO and its members moved toward
forming a document that helps
create a common license framework.
The result was
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/seru">SERU: A Shared Electronic Resource Understanding</a>.
Although all licenses share some
basic similarities,
as discussed in Weir (2016) above,
the details of the hundreds of licenses
a large library has to handle
can get lost in a sea of variability.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/RP-7-2012_SERU.pdf">SERU is a NISO recommended practice</a>
helps to resolve this.
It fosters a common approach
to some aspects of the licensing process and
in fact can be used as
&quot;an alternative to a license agreement&quot;
if a provider and a library agrees to use it.
Like the standard licensing structure
that Weir (2016) outlines,
SERU includes parts that
describe use, inappropriate use,
access, and more
but also posits other stipulations,
such as
confidentiality and privacy.</p>
<h2 id="nasig-core-competencies"><a class="header" href="#nasig-core-competencies">NASIG Core Competencies</a></h2>
<p>We have addressed the
<a href="https://www.nasig.org/Core-Competencies">NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians (NCC)</a>
in earlier sections.
The NCC is a reminder 
of the centrality of licensing
for the ERM librarian.
Section 1.2 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thorough knowledge of electronic resource licensing and the legal
framework in which it takes place.  Since licenses govern the use of
most library electronic resources and have conditions that cannot
knowingly  be  violated,  an ERL with responsibilities related to
licensing must demonstrate familiarity with how and for whom an
organization licenses content, as well as the concepts, implications,
and contract language pertaining to such issues as archival rights,
perpetual access and interlibrary loan.  A practical working
understanding of issues such as copyright and fair use will allow ERLs
to obtain the least restrictive, most library-friendly licensing terms
during publisher/vendor license negotiations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though I have covered NCC
in earlier sections,
it's a reminder that when
we talk about electronic resource management,
we talk about a comprehensive
list of responsibilities,
skills, technologies, and more, and
that we should keep this on our radar.
Second, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2015.1026225">Regan (2015)</a>
specifically mentions these competencies
with respect to the importance of
learning more about the licensing process.</p>
<p>I think it's still true,
seven years after publication and
as Regan (2015) states,
that few library schools cover licensing
and license negotiations and
more broadly,
electronic resource management, but
I think that's changing.
Even if it's covered, like here,
Regan's advice is still important and
the essential questions they ask
are relevant even if you have
extensive experience with the process.</p>
<p>What is also relevant is the
additional theme that Regan (2015)
covers about the importance
of advocating.
Many people are nervous about the
idea of having to negotiate a license
for an e-product, but
in reality,
such work is not done outside of a team.
And that team will likely include
people who work outside of libraries.
This makes it important to advocate
for the library and the licensing process.</p>
<h2 id="liblicense"><a class="header" href="#liblicense">LIBLICENSE</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/">LIBLICENSE</a> is a resource
to assist librarians in crafting, adopting,
and managing licenses for electronic resources.
The project is aimed at university libraries, but
is relevant to other library types, too.
The <a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/licensing-information/model-license/">model licenses</a> page provides a link
to the main template, but
also links to additional model licenses
that cover the United States,
the United Kingdom, and Canada
from various institutional perspectives,
including consortial licensing.</p>
<p>The LIBLICENSE model license
includes helpful details,
such as types of authorized uses and
provisions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>course reserves</li>
<li>course packs</li>
<li>electronic links</li>
<li>scholarly sharing</li>
<li>scholarly citation</li>
<li>text and data mining</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that anything
that is covered in a license is subject
to negotiation between the library and
the vendor.
That does not meant that terms will
be accepted between the parties, but
if something is unfavorable or not
in the best interests of your institution
and patrons,
then that needs to be discussed by all parties.</p>
<p>These model licenses are invaluable
not only from a practicing perspective but
also from an educational perspective.
The more you review,
the more comfortable you will become
working with them.
And, as we will learn in the next section,
one of the most important parts of the
negotiating process is being prepared
to negotiate.
That entails being familiar with the
basic license model.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-10"><a class="header" href="#introduction-10">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Now that we know the basic
structure and contents of
a license for electronic resources,
we can discuss the negotiation process.</p>
<p>We know that because of
projects like SERU,
some licensing may be avoided,
and projects like LIBLICENSE will
help streamline the process
because they provide helpful boilerplate.
When we enter negotiations for some products,
especially big ticket products,
it's helpful to know what
that process might look like, and
of course,
how to go about it.</p>
<h2 id="principled-negotiation"><a class="header" href="#principled-negotiation">Principled Negotiation</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LET4MWO7egI">Abbie Brown (2014)</a> offers a
number of great tips in her talk, and
I want to highlight a few things.</p>
<p>First, her discussion of
<strong>principled negotiation</strong> and
<strong>assertive communication</strong> is important.
Principled negotiation is about
keeping negotiations professional,
even when it feels personal or
when something triggers our anger
in the licensing process.
Before you enter negotiations,
keep in mind the objective you
want to attain; and
use reason, creativity, and
problem solving skills to get there.</p>
<h2 id="assertive-communication"><a class="header" href="#assertive-communication">Assertive Communication</a></h2>
<p>Assertive communication is
being willing to express yourself.
This is not the same as
being aggressive, which
is not warranted.
Brown's (2014) suggestion
to have other people look
at your emails,
that might have been
written in anger,
before sending is golden.</p>
<h2 id="stereotypes"><a class="header" href="#stereotypes">Stereotypes</a></h2>
<p>Brown (2014) also discusses,
based on her experience,
some stereotypes that get in the
way of negotiating.
These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Librarian stereotypes</li>
<li>Library stereotypes</li>
<li>Vendors stereotypes:</li>
</ul>
<p>Stereotypes, from either direction,
should be avoided.
People exist on each side of the
table, and although each
side has their own self-interests,
stereotypes prevent connection.
And reflecting on any stereotypes
we have also reduces anxiety in 
the negotiation process.</p>
<h2 id="community"><a class="header" href="#community">Community</a></h2>
<p>As a negotiator,
Brown (2014) described having
to work with lots of people,
of having to negotiate with
people in her own library.
This is a great insight.
It's very important to
talk through things
with colleagues and vendors.</p>
<h2 id="put-it-in-writing"><a class="header" href="#put-it-in-writing">Put it in Writing</a></h2>
<p>Brown's (2014) point about
putting things in writing
will help you.
You want to write write well
and succinctly,
but if it's in writing,
then it's documented and
can be easily archived and retrieved.</p>
<h2 id="negotiation-workflows"><a class="header" href="#negotiation-workflows">Negotiation Workflows</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2015.1017707">Smith and Hartnett (2015)</a>
provide a real world example
of the negotiating process
that includes a work flow
around licensing.
Remember, document everything and
revisit your documentation.
Importantly, use that documentation
to formalize checklists.
Having a workflow in place
around licensing will help
make your work more efficient
and help ensure that
all bases are covered.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2016.1157008">Dygert and Barrett (2016)</a>
cover the specifics of licensing:
what to look for,
what shouldn't be given away,
how to negotiate principally,
and more.
Likewise, <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/5834">Dunie (2015)</a>
gets into the specifics
of the negotiation process,
which includes definitions of
terms, business models, and strategies.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-4"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-4">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Becoming a skillful negotiator
takes practice, but this
section will help prepare you
to prepare for the process.
The main point I want to make
is this:
if you find yourself in a
position where one
of your job responsibilities
is to negotiate with vendors for e-resources
(or for anything else),
then come back to these
sources of information and
spend additional time studying
them and taking notes on them.
Sources like these, and
others like them,
such as those listed by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2017.1304766">Garofalo (2017)</a>,
in the literature,
will prepare you if you study them.
Being prepared is the
most important step.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-11"><a class="header" href="#introduction-11">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Collection development and acquisitions
is a complex problem for
electronic resources.
To rehash, in the print-only days,
acquiring resources was a
<em>more-than-it-is-now</em> linear process.
Librarians became aware of an item,
sought reviews of the item,
possibly collected the item,
described it, and then shelved it.
And maybe, depending on the
type of the library,
weeded it from the collection
at some future date 
during their regular
course of collection assessment.</p>
<p>The above is a simplistic take, but
there are additional vectors
to be aware of with electronic resources.
First, as we have learned,
libraries may or, more likely,
may not own digital works,
and different subscription services
require different kinds of contracts.
Second, electronic resources
(ebooks, journal articles, databases, etc.)
require different handling and disseminating
procedures due to differences in
technologies and licenses.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19411260903466269">Martin et al. (2009)</a>
pinpoint the issue
when they write that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as we would like to think our primary concerns
about collecting are based on content, not <strong>format</strong>
[emphasis added], e-resources have certainly challenged
many long-established notions of how we buy, collect,
preserve, and provide access to information (p. 217).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="collection-development"><a class="header" href="#collection-development">Collection Development</a></h2>
<p>Although a world where the
format dictates so much makes
an intriguing world,
it can be problematic and worrisome.
We think that content should be king and
that &quot;collection managers should focus
on the content of the information provided,
regardless of the actual form in which the
information arrives&quot;
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0099-1333(94)90043-4">(Harloe &amp; Budd, 1994, p. 83)</a>.
We have already learned that some
<a href="09-markets-economics.html">formats cost more</a>,
but we must also ask,
how does format (or <em>form</em>) either prevent
or facilitate access?
If you catch the implicit gotcha there,
you can see that a thread
connects acquisitions,
collections development, and usability,
the latter which we'll learn more
about later in this work.</p>
<p>In a collection development course,
you would unquestionably focus on
content and on the work that
is involved creating a
collection development policy (CDP),
which I hope you do or
spearhead if your library does not have one.
Content and CDPs are relevant
to the acquisition, collection, and
management of e-resources.
However, in a major way,
it is also important to understand
how the management of electronic resources
have impacted librarian work flows and
how that has shaped, or re-<strong>formed</strong>,
library organizational hierarchy.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-hierarchy"><a class="header" href="#organizational-hierarchy">Organizational Hierarchy</a></h3>
<p>A quick note about the organizational hierarchy.
Such hierarchies are often graphically
presented in organizational charts.
I developed an organizational chart
based on my readings of librarian
departmental reports written during
the late 1950s and early 1960s
by librarians at the University of Kentucky, and thus,
well before electronic resources took over.
These departmental reports are
archived at the University of Kentucky's
<a href="http://libraries.uky.edu/SC">Special Collections Research Center</a>.
Organizational charts have been
around since the 1800s, but
I am not sure when libraries started to
create and use them, and
I didn't see one in my research
on UK Libraries for this time period.
Thus, I inferred an organizational structure
based on the detailed reports written
by the various department heads in the
library at the time (<em>See Fig. 1</em>).
When you compare my chart based on the past
to the most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190722033735/https://libraries.uky.edu/forms/OrgChart.pdf">recent one provided by UK Libraries</a>
(see aside below),
it's clear that additional complexities
have been added.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/1950s60sorgchartUKlibraries.png"

title="Organizational chart UK Libraries late 50s / early 60s">
<figcaption>
Fig. 1. This is a derived organizational chart based on
annual reports of University of Kentucky
departmental head librarians. Research is based on reports
held at the UK Library's Special Collections Research
Center. 
</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: The most recent organizational chart for UK
Libraries is from 2019. Much has changed since then,
including a new Dean, but the general idea should hold
about the complexity of the modern library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This complexity is very interesting.
The growth in electronic resources,
associated technologies, and markets
do not explain all of it:
knowledge has become more specialized, and
library organizational structure reflects that;
student populations have grown
considerably since then,
in size and heterogeneity, and
library structure will reflect that; and
the theory and praxis of library management
has evolved throughout the decades, and
library structure will reflect that.
Other issues are at play, and
it is certainly true that
they are all interconnected.
However, I do think that
technology and e-resources
account for a large portion of
the increasing complexity
that we see here in the difference
between these two organizational charts
at different times of the Library's history.</p>
<p>But again, consider the influence of format.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/CB-04-2015-0006">Lamothe (2015)</a> finds
that if electronic e-reference sources
are collected and perpetually updated,
then they get continually used.
If it's a static e-resource,
then usage declines.
I hope additional studies pursue
this line of questioning
because it raises questions about the
expectations that patrons have about content;
perhaps something about how <em>fresh</em>
they expect that content should be.
It also suggests that a resource
like Wikipedia has an advantage,
since many articles on Wikipedia
are regularly updated (although not all),
and that might lead to a perception
of Wikipedia as <em>fresh</em>,
relative to what is in a library's
collection.</p>
<h2 id="open-educational-resources"><a class="header" href="#open-educational-resources">Open Educational Resources</a></h2>
<p>Let's switch topics to discuss
Open Educational Resources (OER),
which is a hot topic these days.
Textbook prices,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2017.1304767">England et al. (2017)</a> notes,
have skyrocketed in recent decades.
It's suggested that college students budget
<a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/trends-in-college-pricing-student-aid-2022.pdf">up to $1,240 per year in books and supplies</a>,
and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/741558/us-public-school-textbook-expenditure/">public elementary and secondary schools</a>
expend nearly 2.5 billion
dollars per year on textbooks.
In response, libraries have
notably moved to highlight
open educational resources at some level.
For example,
UK Libraries provides resources about
<a href="https://www.uky.edu/copyright/facultyresources/openeducationalresources">Open Educational Resources</a> and
provide a LibGuide on <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/c.php?g=222941&amp;p=6722485">OER</a>.</p>
<p>Sites such as <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/">oercommons.org</a>,
<a href="https://openstax.org/">openstax</a>, <a href="https://libretexts.org/">LibreTexts</a>,
and others function as digital
libraries of open access educational resources.
The idea is to eliminate these
exhorbitant costs,
which put great burdens on taxpayers,
families, and students who pay for them,
by providing high quality,
open access textbooks and other
educational resources.</p>
<p>Most of these resources are,
I believe,
pushed to faculty to replace
proprietary textbooks.
However, it's useful to ask 
whether libraries ought to collect
and acquire these resources,
which would involve promoting
OER at a whole other level.
For example, librarians could
catalog OER items and
add records for them in their
catalogs or discovery systems
(see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0961000611435253">Hill &amp; Bossaller, 2012</a>
for a comparable discussion).
Or should libraries not be involved at all?
This seems like a
<em>duh</em> kind of question, but libraries,
public or academic,
have not traditionally collected textbooks.
So, should they?
Would this change their fundamental mission?
Would it change the game for them as
educational institutions?</p>
<h2 id="collection-development-policies-of-electronic-resources"><a class="header" href="#collection-development-policies-of-electronic-resources">Collection Development Policies of Electronic Resources</a></h2>
<p>Finally, I'd be guilty of a
serious wrongdoing if I did
not discuss the importance of having
a collection development policy (CDP) and
using that policy to guide the collection,
acquisition, and assessment
of electronic resources.
I want to emphasize the
importance of a CDP for e-resources.
Unfortunately, not all libraries,
even at major institutions,
create or use a CDP.
If you end up working at such a library,
I highly encourage you to
convince your colleagues of its importance.
A CDP should define a collection, and
then include most if not
all the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>mission, vision, and values statement</li>
<li>purpose of CDP statement (scope may be included here)</li>
<li>selection criteria: this could be general but it could
also include subsections that focus on specific
populations, genres, resource types, and more</li>
<li>assessment and maintenance criteria</li>
<li>challenged materials criteria (esp important at public,
K-12 libraries)</li>
<li>weeding and/or replacement criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be helpful to see how
libraries treat electronic resources
in those that have policies that
include them.
The following two CDP policies,
one from the
<a href="https://library.louisiana.edu/about-us/policies-procedures/e-resources-serials-management">University of Louisiana (UL)</a> and
one from the
<a href="https://www.lexpublib.org/collection-development-policy">Lexington Public Library (LPL)</a>.
do contain sections on electronic resources.
The UL CDP is not their
main policy but a sub-CDP that
focuses on electronic resources.
The LPL's policy is their main policy.
Although it does not include a
long discussion of electronic resources,
electronic resources are mentioned.
Neither approach is wrong because each
are catered to the specific libraries and their
purposes, communities, and vision statements.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-5"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-5">Conclusion</a></h2>

of electronic resources,

influences workflows,
how electronic resources influences
organizational hierarchies,

resources open has extended to
libraries, and

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chapter-four-patrons"><a class="header" href="#chapter-four-patrons">Chapter Four: Patrons</a></h1>
<p>The chapter on patrons addresses the critical intersection between users and
electronic resources within libraries. Comprising three main topics, these
sections explore: 1. user experience, which offers an analysis of how patrons
interact with digital materials, emphasizing usability, accessibility, and
satisfaction; 2. the evaluation and management of e-resource usage, which
provides an examination of methods to assess, monitor, and enhance the
utilization of e-resources to help ensure that librarians meet the diverse and
evolving needs of their communities; and 3. security and privacy concerns,
which sheds light on the imperative of safeguarding user information and
privacy in the digital age. This includes considerations related to
authentication, data protection, and ethical handling of personal information.
Together, these lectures reflect a user-centric approach to e-resource
management and serve as an essential guide for ERM librarians committed to
enhancing patron engagement, trust, and satisfaction.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="user-experience"><a class="header" href="#user-experience">User Experience</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction-12"><a class="header" href="#introduction-12">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>What is user experience?
<a href="http://www.igi.global.com/chapter/understanding-user-experience/184455">Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018)</a>
write that
&quot;user experience determines
the quality of an interaction
being used by an actor in
order to achieve a specific outcome&quot;
(Intro section, para 1).
<a href="https://doi.org/10.4135/9781483386874.n229">Parush (2017)</a>
highlights adjacent terms
like <em>human-computer interaction (HCI)</em>
and <em>usability</em>.
Let's say then that HCI
encompasses the entire domain of
interaction between people and
computers and
how that interaction is designed and
that <em>user experience (UX)</em>
focuses on the quality of that interaction.
These are not precise definitions.
Some might use the terms <em>UX</em> and <em>HCI</em>
interchangeably.
As ERM librarians, though,
the job is to focus on the
quality of the patron's experience
with electronic services, and
this entails understanding both the
systems and technologies involved
and the users interacting
with these systems and technologies.</p>
<p>Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018) 
outline the parameters involved with UX.
Let me modify their example and
frame it within the context of an ERM
experience for a patron:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actor</strong>: A user of the web resource, like a library
website.</li>
<li><strong>Object</strong>: The web resource, or some part of it.</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: The setting.
<ul>
<li>What's happening?</li>
<li>What's the motivation for use?</li>
<li>What's the background knowledge?</li>
<li>What's the action?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: The tools available by the object and
the look and feel.
<ul>
<li>More specifically, Parush (2017) states that &quot;the user
interface mediates between the user and computer&quot; and it
includes three basic components:
<ul>
<li><em>controls</em>: The tools used to control and interact
with the system: buttons, menus, voice commands,
keyboards, etc.</li>
<li><em>displays</em>: The information presented to the user or
the hardware used to present the information: screens,
speakers, etc.</li>
<li><em>interactions and dialogues</em>: The exchange between the
system and the user including the use of the controls
and responding to feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interaction</strong>: What the actor is doing with the UI</li>
<li><strong>(Intended/Expected/Prior) User experience</strong>: The
intended or expected use of the object. The user's
expectations based on prior use.</li>
<li><strong>(Actual) User experience</strong>: The actions that took place;
the actions that had to be modified based on unintended
results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters would be helpful
for devising a UX study that involves
observing patrons interacting with
a system and then interviewing them to
complete the details.
Note that the same kind of
systematic thinking can be
applied to evaluate other user experiences,
like those between a
librarian and
an electronic resource management system.
Often the focus is on patron user experience,
but it's just as important to
evaluate UX for librarians and
to consider UX when selecting
an ERM system or an ILS system.</p>
<p>In any case,
these parameters help us
step through and highlight the
complicated process of interacting
with a computer, generally, or
a library resource, more specifically.
As with many other topics we've
discussed here,
we can also incorporate these
parameters into a workflow for
evaluating UX.</p>
<h2 id="complex-library-websites"><a class="header" href="#complex-library-websites">Complex Library Websites</a></h2>
<p>It is due to the complexities
involved and a focus on the systems that
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2015.1069527">Pennington (2015)</a>
argues for a more UX centered approach to
library website design.
Think about your own state of
knowledge of ERM before you started
learning about this area of librarianship.
For example,
now that you know somewhat
how link resolvers function,
your experience
using them as patrons and your understanding
of their technical aspects as librarians
provide you with a set of skills
and experiences that make you
more likely to identify the cause
of a malfunction if you find one.
With this ability to suss out an issue,
it becomes easier to solve,
and the experience itself involves less anxiety.
However, most users and patrons of these
systems will not have any technical knowledge
of these systems.
Thus, when these systems break on them,
their frustration with the <strong>experience</strong>
might lead to unfortunate outcomes:
they may not retrieve the information they need;
they may not reach out to a librarian for help; or
they may stop using the library's resources
in preference for something of inferior quality.
We need to remember that this happens,
and if possible,
to build in <em>proactive troubleshooting</em> processes
that anticipate and solve them before they do
happen to patrons.</p>
<p>Here's the crux, though.
As you gain more skill and
expertise with these systems,
you will eventually lose the ability
to see these systems as a novice user, and
that distance will only grow over time.
It is therefore,
as Pennington (2015) argues,
important to gather data from users.
User experience research nurtures
a user centered mindset.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2022.102541">Kraft et al. (2022)</a>
used focus groups and surveys to collect
user experience data on a library's
implementation of its A-Z Database List.
The results of this study are interesting.
As Kraft et al. (2022) point out,
librarians have long made efforts
to reduce the use of library terminology 
in their messaging to patrons,
since this only serves as a point of confusion.
However, their focus group participants
described contrasting opinions about how
color was used on the site, and
how color was used had some fairly
dramatic effects on which sources were selected
to pursue.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-that-exists"><a class="header" href="#the-data-that-exists">The Data That Exists</a></h2>
<p>In addition to user studies
that require conducting direct research
and reading prior studies that require
literature searches,
we should also know that
libraries already possess
a wealth of data to explore,
and this data could
provide needed insight.
Here, as we've learned before,
workflows play an important role
in applying mechanisms to track,
report, and fix problems with various
electronic resource systems.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2015.999521">Browning (2015)</a>,
for example,
describes the use of <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>,
software that's commonly used for software
development for bug tracking and
generating reports about what breaks.
Once problems are identified,
they can be categorized and assigned
to facilitate quick solutions.
Thus, whereas one approach is to understand what
we can learn from data about usage
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2016.1140614">Fry, 2016</a>),
Browning (2015)
describes what we can learn from
data about breakage.
Both kinds of data offer substantial
understanding about user experience.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-6"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-6">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2016.1140614">McDonald (2016)</a>
that despite having around 30
or so years of experience
with web-based and other electronic resource types,
we are still in the throes of disruption.
There's much yet to learn about
design for the web,
just like there's a lot of
left to learn about how to
design a home or office,
and nothing will be settled for a while.
Although I doubt if there will
be any single dominate user experience or
user interface,
since there are many
cultures, backgrounds, and aesthetics,
I'm fairly sure the low-hanging
fruit problems will work out soon enough.
Remember though that 95% of the
cause of all of this complexity is due to
copyright issues,
which necessitate the entire
electronic resource ecosystem and
the complications that
introduced by working with vendors
who work with different,
but overlapping, publishers, etc.
If something were to change about copyright,
then it's a whole new ballgame.</p>
<p>On a final note,
you might be wondering how
<em>information seeking</em> is related
to <em>HCI</em> and to <em>UX</em>.
For example,
we learned from Kraft et al. (2022)
that color can influence what resources
patrons investigate.
Anytime we interact with a
computer (broadly speaking) in
order to seek information,
then we have an overlap with <em>UX</em>.
There are areas of non-overlap, too.
We don't always use computers to
look for information, and
we don't always look for
information on computers.
<em>UX</em> is like this, too.
<em>UX</em> is not always about computers
but can be about user experience generally.
I bring this up because if you do
become involved with <em>UX</em> work at a library
(or elsewhere),
then I'd encourage you to refer
also to the information seeking and
related literature when
it's appropriate to do so.
Remember, it's all about users and
it's also all interconnected.</p>

## Appendix

The suggested reading by Pennington, Chapman, Fry,
Deschenes, and McDonald (2016) is a contribution from four
librarians with theoretical and practical suggestions for UX
research. Both Pennington and Chapman note the best way to
measure UX or detect UX issues is to conduct research with
users (recall our conversations on proactive
troubleshooting), but this isn't always possible due to
financial, time, or other constraints. However, there is a
wealth of research on UX and in the absence of the ability
to conduct research, locating prior research and applying
that research to your setting is paramount. Drawing from the
literature, Chapman describes several important UX
principles that include:

If you can conduct a user study, then Deschenes offers helpful tips on
recruiting users. Remember that the users that you recruit should be actual
users of the systems. If you are interested in why some segments of the
population do not use the library's resources, then that would be a different
kind of study.

<h2 id="introduction-13"><a class="header" href="#introduction-13">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>We've discussed problems 
with defining terms, and
we have learned that much
effort has been expended
into standardizing them.
We have also seen that the
topics that we've covered---technologies,
standards, access, usability, workflow,
markets, licensing---are
linked in some way.
All this complexity makes the
measurement of <em>usage</em> that
much more complicated.
The complication arises when
electronic resources
(or basically all activity on the web
and internet) are accessed from client machines,
a computer server somewhere
keeps a log of that access.
Having logs available makes
it seem that we can have
accurate data about usage,
but it's not a guarantee, and
the insight we may glean
is always difficult to acquire no
matter how much data is available to us.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>999.999.999.999 - - [18/Nov/2022:04:40:38 +0000] &quot;GET /index.html HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 494 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:107.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/107.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Example web server access log entry,
with obfuscated IP address.
Simply by visiting a site,
the web server is able to log
the client's IP address, the timestamp,
the page the client requested,
the client's operating system type and version,
and the client's web browser type and version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Access log data like above can be
good data to explore, but
we have to be mindful that all
data has limitations, and
that there are different ways
to define what usage means.
For example, the log snippet above
indicates that I visited that
a page named <em>index.html</em> on that server, but
does that mean that I really
<strong>used</strong> that website even though
I accessed it?
Even if we can claim that I did,
what kind of use was it?
Can we tell?
(We can actually learn quite
a lot from web server access logs, and
there is software, like Google Analytics,
that would be able
to collect additional usage data.)</p>
<p>As with other things we have discussed,
there have been efforts to standardize
electronic resource usage.
It's an important process because
usage data informs
collection development and
benefits the library in other ways.
Discussions about usage do belong
to the domain of electronic resource librarianship,
but it also overlaps with
other areas of librarianship,
such as systems librarianship or
collection development.
Here we might see job
titles like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=library+systems+administrator">library systems administrator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="project-counter"><a class="header" href="#project-counter">Project Counter</a></h2>
<p>Project Counter is the primary attempt
to standardize how usage is defined,
measured, collected, and shared.
It is a Code of Practice
that provides informative and
consistent reporting
of electronic resource usage.
From <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/introduction-to-counter-code-of-practice-release-5/">Project Counter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its inception in 2002, COUNTER has been focused on
providing a code of practice that helps ensure librarians
have access to consistent, comparable, and credible usage
reporting for their online scholarly information. COUNTER
serves librarians, content providers, and others by
facilitating the recording and exchange of online usage
statistics. The COUNTER Code of Practice provides guidance
on data elements to be measured and definitions of these
data elements, as well as guidelines for output report
content and formatting and requirements for data
processing and auditing. To have their usage statistics
and reports designated COUNTER compliant, content
providers MUST provide usage statistics that conform to
the current Code of Practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These reports were designed to
solve a problem that will likely
never completely be solved, but
it's still an important and useful effort.
The main goal of Counter is to provide
usage reports, and the reports,
for version 5 of Counter,
cover four major areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Titles</li>
<li>Items</li>
</ul>
<p>And you can see which reports
these four replace in
<a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/2448-2/">a table in Appendix B of the Code of Practice</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/foreword/">Counter 5</a> was designed
to include better reporting consistency,
better clarity of metrics that
measure usage activity,
better views of the data, and more.
In order to clarify the
purpose of Counter,
let's review the introduction to the
<a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/introduction-to-counter-code-of-practice-release-5/">Code of Practice</a>,
which articulates the purpose, scope,
application, and more of Counter.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2017.1391153">Pesch (2017)</a> provides a
helpful introduction to the history of
Project Counter and the migration
from Counter version 4 to version 5.
Table 1 in Pesch describes
the four major reports.
Most of the reports are self-explanatory.
Database, Title, and Item reports
cover what they describe,
but Platform reports might
be less obvious.
These reports include usage metrics
at the broadest level and of things
like EBSCOhost databases, ProQuest databases,
SAGE resources, Web of Science databases,
and so on.
These reports come into play when
users/patrons search in the overall
platform but not in any single database
provided by the platform.
For example, UK Libraries subscribes
to the ProQuest Databases and for us,
that includes <a href="https://www.proquest.com/databases/advanced?accountid=11836">35 primary databases</a>.
Users can search many at the same time
or search any single one.
The same holds for platforms
like EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and others.
This is the platform level.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2016.1165783">Scott (2016)</a> illustrates
a nice use case for how Counter
reports can inform collection development.
We've addressed the <em>Big Deal</em> packages
that more libraries are trying to
move away from because such
deals often include access to titles
that are not used or not relevant to a
library community.
Here Scott shows that it might
be possible to avoid subscribing to
some services using this data, but
it's also important to closely read
through and understand the
problems associated with
interlibrary loan, the metrics, and
other limitations described
in the Conclusion section of this article.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-metrics"><a class="header" href="#the-value-of-metrics">The Value of Metrics</a></h2>
<p>We move away from Project Counter with the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5860/crl12-406">Stone and Ramsden (2013)</a>.
I introduce this article because it
highlights how metrics can be used to
assess the value of a library,
which is often underestimated by
administration but constantly
required in order to garner the
resources needed to improve or
sustain a library's resources.
Here Stone and Ramsden investigate
the correlation (not causation)
between library usage and student retention.
Increasing the latter is the
Holy Grail of college and universities.
If this were a public library report,
it might be interesting to see how well
electronic library usage correlates
to continued usage and how such a correlation
might result in various outcomes
defined by the library.
One nice thing about the Stone and Ramsden
article is that it does not depend on
quantitative metrics alone but supports
its findings through qualitative research.
There's only so much a usage metric can say.</p>
<h2 id="using-metrics"><a class="header" href="#using-metrics">Using Metrics</a></h2>
<p>I would like you to be
aware of the
<a href="https://code4lib.org/"><em>code{4}lib</em> journal</a>
and this article by <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10589">Zou</a> is pretty cool.
Although this article overlaps
with some security issues,
a topic that we'll cover
in the final section,
the article also provides a
way of thinking outside the box about the
metrics that you have access to as
an electronic resource librarian.
Here, Zou describes a process of taking
EZproxy logs
(compare the example entry with
the web server entry I included above)
and turning them into something useful
and dynamic by incorporating
some additional technologies.
Recall that <a href="https://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html">EZproxy</a> is
software that authenticates
users and provides access given
that authentication.
We use EZproxy at UK whenever
we access a paywalled journal article.
That is, you've noticed the
<strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong> string in any URL for a
journal that you've accessed via
UK Libraries' installation of EZproxy, and
the URL <code>https://login.ezproxy.uky.edu/login</code>
is the log in URL.
Zou specifically references
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210716020704/https://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/post/analyzing-ezproxy-logs/">the standard way</a>
of analyzing these logs
(take a look at the page at that link),
which can be insightful and helpful,
but Zou's method makes the analysis of
these logs more visual and real-time.
The main weakness with Zou's method
is that it seems to me to be highly
dependent on Zou doing the work.
If Zou leaves their library,
then this customized analysis might not last.
Still, it's good to know that if you have
an interest in developing skills with
systems administration,
with various other technologies,
and with some basic scripting language,
this kind of thing, and more, is possible.</p>
<h2 id="getting-creative"><a class="header" href="#getting-creative">Getting Creative</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2017.1281788">Smith &amp; Arneson (2017)</a> detail
very creative and fun ways to collect usage data
about resource usage when vendors do not provide
usage data.
In the first part of this article,
Smith describes how they analyzed
their link resolver reports
to infer what users were accessing
in their collections.
Arneson's section describes using a
Linux file search utility called <code>grep</code>
to construct search queries of the EZproxy logs
and deduce usage of specific electronic resources. 
Since both methods require sifting through
log entries like the one I highlighted above,
the process requires some sleuthing, testing,
time, and patience.
However, once figured out,
the process and reports can easily be
automated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-7"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-7">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Librarians used a variety of techniques
to collect usage data in the print era, but
like many things we've learned about,
electronic resources have complicated things.
First, because more data is available about
usage with electronic resources,
before that data can be used,
it has to be defined.
Project Counter is an attempt to define
what usage means and how to report it.</p>
<p>Quantitative metrics should will never
be able to provide a complete picture
of how a library's collections are used, but
they are an important part.
Not only do they help librarians manage
their collections,
they also help librarians show proof 
of their collection's importance to their
communities.
Furthermore, with a little
skill, practice, and creativity,
usage logs can also be used to build
cool apps (Zou, 2015)
or help fill in the gaps when
vendors fall short in their requirements
(Smith &amp; Arneson, 2017).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="privacy-and-security"><a class="header" href="#privacy-and-security">Privacy and Security</a></h1>
<p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5860/ltr.52n4">Breeding (2016)</a> begins 
with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Libraries have a long tradition of taking extraordinary
measures to ensure the privacy of those who use their
facilities and access their materials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is mostly true but not entirely so.
When I was an undergraduate,
I remember going to the library to look
for books on a sensitive topic.
I saw a book on the shelves
that looked relevant, and
when I pulled it off the shelf
and opened it,
I noticed that a friend of mine
had checked the book out before me
because their name was written
on the due date card in their handwriting.
Even though I had grown up
with these due date cards
in library books,
it had never occurred to me before
then how these cards could
pose a problem with privacy.
At the time,
I decided not to check out
that book because of that issue.</p>
<p>We might be comforted in
thinking that the kind of
information that was supposedly
revealed to me in the book that
my friend had checked out, and
that I had opened,
is the kind of information that
would not scale up easily.
It was a serendipitous event that
involved me looking for a book
on the same topic and then just
happening to pick the one book
that my friend had used.
It's not likely, then, that
this might pose a big problem at scale.</p>
<p>However, let's think of that
information in that due date
card as metadata,
and then ask,
how could we use it?
The sociologist Kieren Healy
did that kind of thing with membership
lists from colonial times.
He showed that using limited
data like the one I found in that book,
some important things could be discovered.
For example, <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/">Healy</a> imagined
that if the British had access to
simple social network analysis
methods in 1772,
they could have identified that
Paul Revere was a patriot and then
have used that information
to prevent or interfere with
the American Revolution.
I encourage you to read his blog entry and
his <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/11/following-up-on-paul-revere/">follow-up reflection</a>
because it is a neat
<em>what-if</em> hypothetical case study.</p>
<p>Most libraries in North America
have replaced due date slips
with bar codes,
and while this has removed
the problem above,
the overall migration from
paper-based workflows to
electronic ones have
raised other problems.
Not long after the Patriot Act
was passed after 9/11,
FBI agents ordered a Connecticut librarian to
<a href="https://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-librarians-stand-up-to-patriot-act-again-20160927-story.html">&quot;identify patrons who had used
library computers online at a
specific time one year earlier&quot;</a>.
Per the law,
the librarians involved were
placed under a gag order,
which prevented them from speaking out.
This led to a lawsuit against the 
US Attorney General.
Eventually the librarians were released
from their gag order and
allowed to discuss the event.</p>
<p>There are occasionally big,
dramatic cases like the one
described above, but
privacy and security issues are
often much more mundane but
still quite important.
Since many users of libraries
of all types visit library homepages,
then encrypting all the web/internet
traffic is important.
A couple of years ago, the
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/browsers-to-block-access-to-https-sites-using-tls-1-0-and-1-1-starting-this-month/">major web browsers announced</a>
that they would no longer support
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
protocol versions 1.1 or earlier, and
that any site that had not yet migrated
to TLS version 1.2 or above
will not be accessible.
TLS is used to encrypt web traffic.
This news came out in early March 2020, and
the pandemic followed soon after.
The browser vendors thus postponed
blocking poorly encrypted websites for a few months.
It took a while for some websites
to begin using the new version of TLS and
some sites were inaccessible for a while even
with the advanced notice.</p>
<p>In fact, for a while I had to enable
an insecure connection to libraries.uky.edu in
Firefox if I wanted to visit it.
When I enabled it,
then my activity on libraries.uky.edu
was potentially visible to others under
certain conditions.
Note, however, that once I signed
into my library account,
I'm transferred to Primo's cloud service,
and then to UK's OAuth page.
These parts of the encryption
chain are fairly strong.
So it's only activity specifically on
libraries.uky.edu that was not good at the time.</p>
<p>Breeding (2016) introduces a
variety of technologies and policies
that are related to security and privacy.
These encompass important
technological considerations,
like web traffic encryption.
There are also important
policy considerations, too,
like how third party vendors implement
privacy and security mechanisms,
like the Primo example above.
<a href="https://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2021/ethical-financial-stewardship/">DiVittorio and Gianelli (2021)</a>
discuss the issue of privacy and security
issues with third party vendors.
Overall, their findings highlight
the lack of alignment between
the values of librarians and the profit-based
motives of vendors.
It's also important to note how 
unresponsive many vendors were to 
their requests to participate in data collection.
Remember that <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-7-2012-seru">SERU</a> has a
section in its recommended practice
dedicated to Confidentiality and Privacy.
In case you work at a library that
does not use SERU,
this is how SERU can be useful to you.
It can inform us of
the kinds of provisions that a
library ought to have in a license if the
default provisions a vendor proposes
do not include the necessary components.</p>
<p>There are some pros and cons with
intentionally choosing services that
make library usage less private.
A number of library sites use
Google Analytics to track site
usage and other metrics.
Understanding how patrons use library websites
is important, but
this means that our actions,
albeit somewhat anonymized,
on these library sites are being
collected and stored by Google
(or some other analytic service).
Also, many websites,
library websites included,
use fonts that are hosted on other servers,
but doing so entails another tracking mechanism, too,
since anytime a page is visited that contains
a font sourced from another server,
a log entry is added of that usage.
There's a trade-off,
as I mentioned.
If we want to learn more about
how users interact with library websites
in order to improve usability and accessibility,
then we have to have some of this data.
Here's where a privacy policy
might come into play.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-8"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-8">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Like all things I've covered in this work,
the move to electronic resources has disrupted
how we think about and handle the privacy
and security of our patrons.
The DiVittorio and Gianelli (2021) article,
in fact, highlights how more than ever,
much of what we might like to protect and
keep secure is completely out of librarians' control,
and that this has potential ramifications for
our communities, and especially,
for our marginalized and unprotected ones.</p>
