<p>In this section, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide examples of electronic resources,</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>This semester we're learning about electronic resources
and about how to manage them.
We begin by outlining the kinds of things
that are electronic resources.
<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/940697515">Karin Wikoff</a> (2011) outlines the major categories,
and these include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>databases</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>A&amp;I databases</strong> (abstracting and indexing)</li>
<li><strong>bibliographic databases</strong> full text databases</li>
<li><strong>journal collections</strong>
<ul>
<li>Project Muse</li>
<li>JSTOR</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>specialized and hybrid databases</strong>
<ul>
<li>chemical databases: e.g., <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">Pubchem</a></li>
<li>genetic databases: e.g.,  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a></li>
<li>stock databases: e.g., <a href="https://data.nasdaq.com/search">Nasdaq</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>primary source databases</strong>
<ul>
<li>original newspapers: e.g., <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">Chronicling America</a> </li>
<li>oral histories: e.g., <a href="https://kentuckyoralhistory.org/">Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ejournals</li>
<li>ebooks (see note below)</li>
<li>linking technologies: e.g., technologies that embed metadata in URLs and send
across networks:
<ul>
<li>Z39.50</li>
<li>OpenURL</li>
<li>Federated search</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ebooks: The technology is rather complicated and
differentiated depending on the copyright status,
the file type (PDF, ePUB, TXT, etc.),
the purpose or genre
(textbook, fiction or non-fiction, etc.).
In some  cases, ebooks are software applications and
not just plain or marked up text, and
they also vary by platform or
the application interacting with the text,
which offer different types of functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linking technologies allow users
to begin in one search system,
like an OPAC, and
extend a query to other systems
without initiating searches in those other systems.
For example, a user begins a search on WorldCat.org and
finds a book that's available at a nearby library.
The  user only needs to click on the local library link and
be transferred to that library's OPAC.
If that works (it doesn't always),
then the user may submit a request to pick up the book.
That involves additional actions,
including  logging into the user's library account. </p>
<h2 id="framing"><a class="header" href="#framing">Framing</a></h2>
<p>As you surmise from the above list,
electronic resources are a major part of any library,
whether academic, public, school, or special.
The need to manage them and
incorporate the management of them
into a library work flow requires
attending to many parts of a big system.
This will be much of what we'll discuss and
learn about this semester.
It will get complicated.
The print only era of libraries
was difficult enough for many reasons, but
managing print and using print resources
was comparably a more linear process.
Electronic resources have raised the stakes
That might be expected:
civilizations had 500 years
to develop and solve print technology,
yet we have had only about three  or so decades of
experience with digital technology.
We are a long way off from stability, and
many of the challenges and frustrations
ahead of us are not simply technical but
also social and legal.</p>
<h2 id="our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship"><a class="header" href="#our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship">Our Readings: The nature of ERM librarianship</a></h2>
<p>Our readings this week provide
introductions to electronic resource librarianship
and help frame this course.</p>
<h3 id="a-specialist-and-a-generalist"><a class="header" href="#a-specialist-and-a-generalist">A Specialist and A Generalist</a></h3>
<p>The first article by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07317131.2017.1385286">Stachokas</a> (2018)
surveys the history of this specialist/generalist librarian role.
Stachokas (2018) finds that
the electronic resource librarian has their feet
planted in technical services and collection development,
that this requires a holistic understanding of the 
electronic resource work flow,
of its embeddedness in the scholarly and library ecosystem, and
that this division is leading to different areas of specialization:
those who focus on
&quot;licensing, acquisitions, and collection development&quot; (p. 15),
and those who focus on
&quot;metadata, discovery, management of knowledge bases, and
addressing technical problems&quot; (p. 15).
This rings true to me.
In my own observations,
I've noticed that job announcements have increasingly stressed
one of the above areas and not both.</p>
<h3 id="the-technical-communicator-as-the-bridge"><a class="header" href="#the-technical-communicator-as-the-bridge">The Technical Communicator as the &quot;Bridge&quot;</a></h3>
<p>In the second article,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2016.1164555">Hulseberg</a> (2016) uses
the field of technical communication (TC)
to interpret the field of electronic resource librarianship.
Hulseberg (2016) takes the view that an
electronic resource librarian is, among other things,
a technical communicator.
This is much different from being
someone who helps patrons with their technical problems.
Rather, this is someone who completes advanced work in
documenting and reporting technical processes.</p>
<p>Hulseberg (2016) highlights four important themes about ERM:
the interesting themes to me are
<em>Theme one: Metaphors of &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;translator&quot;</em>, and
<em>Theme Two: Collaborating in a web of relationships</em>.
When I was an undergraduate,
I imagined the job that I wanted
would be one involving connecting people in different silos
to each other by helping them communicate with each other.
It turns out that,
under Hulseberg's (2016) view,
electronic resource librarianship does this work.
However, the other themes are just as important, and
in particular, Theme Four, about jurisdiction,
highlights one of the major disruptive acts on librarianship
in the last thirty or forty years.</p>
<p>Consider that most people, researchers and scholars included,
use non-library provided resources to locate information.
Additionally, more works, scholarly and non-scholarly,
are freely and publicly available on the web,
e.g., as <a href="https://sparcopen.org/open-access/">open access (OA)</a>.
This means that the library
is becoming disintermediated
as a result of people using sites non-library services,
like Google or Google Scholar,
to retrieve freely available works on the web,
instead of at the library.
As a result, what becomes of the core jurisdiction of the librarian?
And of the electronic resource librarian, in particular?
In concrete terms: a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-03-2018-0047">recent paper</a> (Klitzing, 2019)
reported that researchers state they use
Google Scholar 83% of the time and
EBSCOhost 29% of the time to find relevant material.
That raises strategic and technical questions about the today's role
of the librarian and library in the scholarly communication system.</p>
<h3 id="to-license-or-not-to-license"><a class="header" href="#to-license-or-not-to-license">To License or Not To License</a></h3>
<p>The third article, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2016.02.002">Zhu</a> (2016),
places a different theoretical lens
on what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.
Zhu (2016) posits that the licensing aspect of
electronic resource management significantly influenced
ER librarianship identity.
One reason why Zhu's (2016) findings are insightful is
due to the fact that we often license electronic resources
rather than buy them.
Copyright law, historically, has provided librarians
with their most important legal justification
for collecting and lending works:
the <a href="https://search.copyright.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=copyright&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=%22first+sale+doctrine%22">First Sale Doctrine</a>.
Copyright law provides copyright owners with the
right to distribute their work, but
the first sale doctrine holds that if you buy a book,
then you have a right to lend or sell your copy.
This doctrine is fundamental to librarianship but
also raises problems today since most digital works
(ebooks, etc)
are licensed and not bought by libraries.</p>
<p>Stachokas (2018), Hulseberg (2016), and Zhu (2016)
present the historical and environmental forces
that have shaped the work of electronic resource librarians and
their professional identities, and
each of these authors discuss important themes
that function as evidence of these identities.
In our discussions this week,
we should focus on these themes and
how you make sense of it all.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Electronic resource librarianship is one of the
most fascinating areas of librarianship to me.
Because digital technologies have woven their way
into all parts of the contemporary library ecosystem,
and because these digital technologies bring with them
a slew of legal and social challenges,
electronic resource librarians have had,
as these technologies have developed,
to maintain a holistic view of this ecosystem just
as they have had to specialize in key areas that
require maintaining that holistic, interconnected view.</p>
<p>The course takes that holistic view and
divides it into four parts for study.
In the first part,
we will continue to study the nature of the work itself:
of what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.</p>
<p>In the second part, we will learn about the technologies
that an electronic resource librarian uses and
the conditions that shape these technologies.
We will learn about integrated library systems (ILS) and
how these systems conform (or not) to standards,
how they foster or obstruct 
interoperability and electronic access.</p>
<p>In the third part, we focus on processes and their contexts.
We will study the electronic resource librarian's workflow,
the economics and the markets of electronic resources,
what is involved in licensing these resources and
negotiating with vendors.</p>
<p>At the end, we will focus on patrons and end users;
that is, those we serve. 
Because electronic resources are digital,
usage of them leaves behind traces of that usage.
This means we will study how that usage is measured and
what those measurements can validly say.
Electronic resources means having to use websites, and
thus we will study how electronic resource librarians
are involved in user experience studies.
Because usage leaves traces of personal information,
we will end this course on topics related to the
security of these resources and the privacy of those
who use them.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-questions"><a class="header" href="#discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</a></h2>
<p>As we start to address all of this, I want us to consider two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we manage all of this electronic stuff? Not only does it include
complicated technology and has an impact on our patrons, but it involves of
different sorts of librarians.</li>
<li>What exactly is an electronic resource librarian? I like this basic question
because, due to perhaps representations in the media (movies, TV shows,
books) and the interactions we've had with librarians in our lifetimes, we
all have pretty well-defined, whether accurate, images of what reference or
cataloging librarians are. But what about an electronic resource librarian?
This is something different, right? And it's not likely to be a position
that's ever really captured and presented publicly.</li>

<p>Class, in this section, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame the readings</li>
<li>discuss the readings, and</li>
<li>list some questions to guide our discussion for the week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal in this section is
to understand how the job of
electronic resource management (ERM)
has changed throughout the years and
to develop some ideas about where it is headed.</p>
<h3 id="framing-1"><a class="header" href="#framing-1">Framing</a></h3>
<p>This week we read two articles
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2014.03.013">Hartnett, 2014</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lcats.2009.11.001">Murdock, 2010</a>)
that analyze electronic resource librarian job advertisements.
Additionally, the reading list includes
the NASIG core competencies
for electronic resource librarianship.
I suggest that you review the core competencies list
before you read the articles.</p>
<p>These articles are of interest since
they capture a description of electronic resource librarianship
in its earlier years.
There are many social, political, and economic conditions that
have stayed about the same since these articles were published,
and these conditions help fixate the work of the ERM librarian,
but constant changes in technologies and types of electronic resources
have meant that eletronic resource librarians are
constantly adapting to new work flows.
Our Murdoch (2010) reading makes this point.</p>
<p>Though the technology differs,
the descriptions and duties of ER jobs are still on the mark.
I posted links to job announcements
in the discussion forum to demonstrate this.
The job announcements were emailed to the <a href="https://www.nasig.org/SERIALST">SERIALST</a>
email list (please subscribe to it) and
are not current job openings, but
they were current within the last few years.</p>
<p>To follow up on more current advertisements for ER librarians,
I did a Google search on August 15, 2022 using the following query:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;electronic resource librarian&quot; job
</code></pre>
<p>Results are consistent with past qualifications listed in the links
mentioned above and
with the <a href="01-the-erm-librarian.html">last section's</a> discussions
on the nature of ERM librarianship.
I will withhold linking to these advertisements since I don't expect
the links to persist as the positions get filled.
But several sources outline the following requested qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide &quot;consistent and reliable access to the Library's electronic resources
and establishing workflows that maintain discovery and use of all Library
collections&quot;</li>
<li>analyze &quot;feasibility of technical platforms&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;resource licensing and contracting&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;copyright compliance&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;vendor negotiations&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Acts as a bridge across multiple Library units&quot;</li>
<li>enhance &quot;access and use&quot;</li>
<li>design a &quot;system of access&quot;</li>
<li>analyze &quot;staff and user issues with discovery of resources&quot;</li>
<li>coordinate &quot;system administration responsibilities for integrated library
system (Ex Libris Alma/Primo VE) with Technical Services Librarian&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;create reports in Alma and individual databases as needed, including but not
limited to usage statistics, user experience statistics, collection analysis
and overlap&quot;</li>
<li>monitor &quot;listservs for Alma and Primo VE&quot;</li>
<li>manage &quot;administrative and troubleshooting functions for EZ Proxy and
e-resource vendors for access and authentication&quot;</li>
<li>evaluate &quot;the scope and quality of research resources available&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;reviews and negotiates licenses for [...] purchased resources and manages the
acquisition, activation, and troubleshooting of all purchased and subscribed
electronic resources for the Library.&quot;</li>
<li>gathers and analyzes &quot;serials, e-books, database usage, and other related
assessment data&quot;</li>
<li>oversees &quot;the activities of the serials acquisitions unit&quot;</li>

</ul>
<p>To stay current about the position overall and
about the specific duties involved,
I encourage you to bookmark and
stay abreast of relevant journals in the area.
In addition to the two publication titles drawn from for this
section's readings
and to the SERIALST list I have asked you to subscribe to,
I recommend that you bookmark the

<h3 id="our-readings"><a class="header" href="#our-readings">Our Readings</a></h3>
<p>In this section,
we start with Murdock's (2010) overview of the
electronic resource librarian's position
in the first decade of this century.
We proceed to Harnett's (2014) work that describes the
electronic resource librarian's duties around ten years ago.
NASIG's core competencies were also published around ten years ago
and have only received minor revisions since then.
We conclude by considering the current job advertisements
listed above and elsewhere.
With these,
our goal in this section is to get a sense of the
electronic resource librarian's job duties and
available technologies
from the earlier part of this century to now;
to understand where it was, how it has evolved,
and where it might be headed.
Overall, you will get a sense of just how much
this position has changed in the intervening years,
what I refer to as <strong>constant disruption</strong> in the next section.</p>
<p>One of the useful aspects of Murdock's (2010) article
is in section 4.3,
which lists a 'timeline of commercial ERM developments and standards.'
These technologies and standards
continue today,
and have, via hindsight,
strongly shaped the how electronic resources currently work.
This timeline includes what's now referred to
as the A-Z list of serials,
which started in 2000,
OpenURL linking technology from 2001,
the combining of both integrated library systems (ILS)
and electronic resource management systems (ERMS) in 2004,
federated searching from 2005,
SUSHI usage statistics protocol from 2006,
and SERU from 2007.
We will explore each of these topics in future sections.</p>
<p>Murdock's (2010) analysis shows that some of the duties
started to wane in the early years.
Website maintenance and deployment (see Fig 13),
for example,
completely dropped off the radar.
This was likely due to the development of
content management systems,
i.e., turnkey website solutions,
that are still in use today.
For example, I remember <a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>
and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>,
both content management systems that
can work as library websites,
taking off around 2007 to 2009,
around the time that Murdock shows this area of activity declining.</p>
<p>One of Murdock's (2010) conclusions is that
employers sought &quot;to hire those who are able to perform
traditional librarian duties, such as reference and
instructional service, in addition to e-resource specific
tasks&quot; (p. 37).
Based on what we see in job advertisements today,
this seems to be much less the case as
electronic resource librarians have become more specialized,
as the position has divided into two areas
(cf., technical services aspect and collection development aspect),
and as electronic resources have grown and become more
dominant in the intervening years.
ER librarians will still liaison with their communities but
in different ways (i.e., not as reference librarians).</p>
<p>A big change since 2012,
when Harnett's (2014) research ends,
is that more technology has moved to the cloud.
What this means is that we rely less on onsite servers,
where those servers might be managed by library IT (or other IT).
This requires different types of technological skills
and suggests that conceptual knowledge
(e.g., the kind that we tend to focus on in library schools)
is paramount.
(This is my opinion, but it's based on years of
doing and teaching systems administration work.)
For example, it's more important to have a conceptual understanding
of how metadata works than to know how to use some
piece of software for managing metadata
(aside: however, conceptual and practical knowledge
cannot so easily be divorced from each other).
Metadata standards and schemes change far less often
than the software.</p>
<p>Cloud-based solutions have changed
the field in other ways.
Hosted software means
the software isn't purchased but leased,
and leasing involves outside vendors
who must have the technological skill sets
and resources to manage the technology.
So we rely, in very important ways, on others more:
we are more dependent on other actors in the
publishing and e-resource provider ecosystem.
That involves a lot of trust, and
it means more negotiations between
librarians and vendors and
the ability to collaborate and develop good, ethical
relationships.
The kind of work that may increase,
as more software and data are hosted on the cloud,
might be the kind of work that requires strong communication
skills, strong negotiating skills, and
knowledge of how licensing works,
how copyright and contract law work, and
how electronic resource collections work and
inter-operate across platforms.
However, again, this can be complicated.
A couple of years ago there was an email on the SERIALST listserv
by a librarian that asked whether librarians
have retained powers to negotiate and sign contracts.
The responses were mixed.
Some librarians had the jurisdiction but
many had lost it, per the email responses.
Even under this scenario, though,
technological understanding is necessary
in order to negotiate the best deal for a library's stakeholders and
to acquire the best and
most seamless product needed by library users.</p>
<p>Even though IT continues to be outsourced,
this doesn't mean that we can become lax
in our understanding of how the technology works;
just as we can't become lax in how librarianship
works even though librarians answer fewer reference questions
than they did in previous years
(i.e., you still need to know how to respond
systematically and thoroughly
to research and reference questions).
What I mean is that,
in order to communicate this topic well,
to negotiate well, and
to sign licenses that are beneficial to our communities,
it helps to understand and
be adept at the tech so that
we are not bamboozled in those negotiations.
Also, if something goes wrong,
e.g., with the link resolver technology,
we have to learn how to identify the likely culprit;
that is, whether the technological issue
is the link resolver technology and not something else,
like the OPAC technology.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-1"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-1">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I want you to think about these
job advertisement studies in relation
to what you are learning about electronic resources
as well as in relation to the kinds of advertisements
you've seen since whenever you started paying attention to them,
like those outlined at the beginning of this section.
In essence, think about where you see yourself
in these advertisements and how they impact you.</p>
<p>Although you may be only learning about
these technologies in the abstract,
it might be the case that most of you
haven't had a chance to learn the electronic resource back ends.
That doesn't disqualify you from attempts
to start reflecting on this part of librarianship.
As library users of these technologies,
you have gathered enough abstract and practical knowledge
to know enough.</p>
<h3 id="questions-for-discussion"><a class="header" href="#questions-for-discussion">Questions for Discussion</a></h3>
<p>We'll soon move away from reflective questions and
get our hands dirty with specific technologies, licensing, etc.,
but for now let's reflect on the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you think you stand in comparison to ERM job ads and to <a href="https://www.nasig.org/Competencies-Eresources">NASIG Core
Competencies</a>?
<ul>
<li>Where are you strong?</li>
<li>Where would you like to improve?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What can you (and we, as a course community) do to help each of you get there?
<ul>
<li>What's your path?</li>
<li>What can you practice?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I think we might conclude at this point that there are many
different ways to frame the role of the
electronic resource librarian.
In <a href="01-the-erm-librarian.html">The ERM Librarian chapter</a>,
Stachokas (2018) showed how the
electronic resource librarian works across technical
services and collection development and
how this requires a holistic view as well as a specialized
understanding of the various processes involved.
Huleberg (2016) illustrated how framing
electronic resource librarianship as a technical
communicator yields important insights into the work
and profession.
Zhu (2016) used the licensing aspect of electronic resource
management work to show how central this activity
is to the field's identity.</p>
<p>In the
<a href="02-desperately-seeking-erm-librarian.html">Desperately Seeking an ERM Librarian</a>
section,
we reviewed a list of qualifications from current job
advertisements for electronic resource librarian positions.
In Murdock (2010),
we learned how these kinds of qualifications are tied
to various technological developments.
As the technology changes, and it changes a lot
(see <strong>aside</strong> below),
so do the qualifications.
One of the big takeaways from Harnett's (2014) article,
for me at least,
is that conceptual knowledge of the relevant technology
is more important than practical knowledge,
although the two are not always so easily divorced
from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: See The Library Technology Guides' page on
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/mergers/"><em>The History of Mergers and Acquisitions</em></a>
<em>in the Library Technology Industry</em> to get a sense of
how much change has taken place in the last 40+ years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the readings so far,
I think it's safe to say that the work of
electronic resource librarianship is one of
constant disruption.
And by that I mean,
it might be more difficult to find a thread of continuity,
from its early days to now,
in this role than it would be in other areas of
librarianship.
That might be part of what makes this area so interesting,
but it does present some challenges.</p>
<h2 id="framing-2"><a class="header" href="#framing-2">Framing</a></h2>
<p>The first listed reading we have this week is by
Marshall Breeding.
Astute observers will note Breeding is one of the
first cited authors in the two additional readings
we have this week.
We will read more from Breeding later, but
I bring him up now because he oversees a website titled
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/">Library Technology Guides</a>.
If you would like to keep abreast of the recent news
on the electronic resource industry,
Breeding's website should be at the top of your list.</p>
<p>Breeding's <em>What is ERM?</em> article is a good one
to start the week.
He provides an outline of the various components of
electronic resources, and
he provides some historical context for those components.</p>
<h3 id="the-focus-on-academic-libraries-is-misleading"><a class="header" href="#the-focus-on-academic-libraries-is-misleading">The Focus on Academic Libraries is Misleading</a></h3>
<p>One caveat, though:
while all the articles on our list this week are focused on
academic libraries,
the terms, concepts, and processes described
in these articles are relevant to other areas of
librarianship such as public librarianship,
school media librarianship, and so forth.
Differences in processes and in some details will
arise due to organizational or other contextual differences
among these library types.
Organizationally, for example, public libraries are
connected to municipalities, county governments,
state libraries, and to public library consortia.
This presents unique organizational challenges, and
it highlights the fact that municipal, county, or state laws
will define how some processes must be handled and
who must handle them.
The same is true for public schools, and in such cases,
school boards and school districts will likely be involved
(see <strong>aside</strong> below).
Contextual differences that shape electronic resource
management include user communities.
An academic library serves its students, faculty, staff, and
perhaps the public to some degree.
However, a public library serves its local community.
Such differences will shape ERM workflows and other choices,
like the chosen vendors and publishers.
For example, academic libraries provide more scholarly
sources, and public libraries provide more ebooks and
audiobooks and less e-journals.
This means that you might find services like
OverDrive/Libby, Epic, and Hoopla
offered by public libraries but not in academic ones, and
that you will rarely find more advanced scholarly resources
in public libraries.
These differences in needs, due to different communities,
will change the emphasis on some aspects
of the ERM work flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: As an example, see the impact that the current
book bans are having on ebook providers and note all
the parties involved in these situations, including:
superintendents, county officials, county school system,
school district employees, etc.
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/library-apps-book-ban-schools-conservative-parents-rcna26103">NBC News</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reason why our reading lists
lean toward the academic setting is not because
electronic resource management is not relevant to public
or other types of libraries, but it is because
academic librarians publish more about
electronic resources and public librarians publish very little.
For example, I conducted a search in <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/803">LISTA</a>
with the following query,
which returned just three results in 2021 when I first ran
the query and four results in August 2022 when I ran it again.
In fact, a new article wasn't published since the 2021
query. Rather, LISTA just added an addition item from 2015.</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>It does not get much better if I expand the query
to include some additional thesauri terms.
This query returns only six results in 2021 and seven in
2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;PUBLIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>However, if I focus that query on academic libraries,
then the results increase substantially.
The following query returns 51 hits in 2021 and 57 in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And this query returns 82 results in 2021 and 90 in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>We could continue to explore <strong>LISTA</strong> or other databases
for relevant material on ERM and public libraries, and
we would find more.
For example, more results are retrieved when I attach 
terms like <strong>e-resources</strong>, <strong>integrated library systems</strong>,
<strong>discovery platforms</strong>, or <strong>ebooks</strong> to a public library
search in LISTA.
But the results are nearly always much less than
academic library searches.
Another example, my local library system,
<a href="https://lexpublib.org/">Lexington Public Library</a>,
uses the <a href="https://librarytechnology.org/product/carlx/">CARL</a> integrated library system,
but there doesn't appear to be any articles in LISTA
about it since 2015.</p>
<p>Anyway, you get the picture.
There simply isn't a lot of material on
electronic resource management from the
public library perspective, and
a quick search in the school media sphere
mirrors this issue, too.
The following search return zero results in 2021 and in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;LIBRARY media specialists&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>If you go into public librarianship or
school media librarianship,
I'd encourage you to publish on electronic resources.
It would greatly benefit your peers and those of us
who teach courses like this.</p>
<p>Back to Breeding.
I understand some terms Breeding uses and the technologies
he describes might still be new to us.
Let me spend some time providing some additional
background information and highlighting some things
to look for in these three articles.</p>
<p>Librarians started to migrate to
electronic resource management in the 1970s.
Breeding mentions this.
This is when it happened en masse, but the seeds were
planted well before this.
I published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2013.0051">a paper</a> a few years ago that
provides a historical account of the first library
automation project,
which took place in the 1930s with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">Hollerith punched cards</a>.
By the 1960s,
the primary use of computers was to manage circulation, and
in the late 60s and early 70s,
library automation focused on managing patron records.
In the early 1970s, tools became available to manage and
search bibliographic records.
Hence, computers were first used mostly to manage the
circulation of books,
then patron records,
which allowed patrons to check out works <em>electronically</em>,
and then we had the ability to search for works.
If a work of interest was located using these tools,
the work could be retrieved from the shelves or ordered
via interlibrary loan by snail mail.
Full text search came much later with the introduction
of better storage media, like CD-ROMs, and
saw major growth with the introduction of the internet to
more institutions in the 1980s
and the web in the early 1990s,
which at its heart is nothing more than a big
document retrieval system.</p>
<p>In the process of migrating from print to electronic,
all sorts of things had to change, but
all that change rests on the major premise of librarianship:
<strong>to provide access by organizing information
in order to retrieve information</strong>.
Although you may have often heard that libraries
are ancient entities,
libraries and librarianship as we understand them today
did not modernize until the late 1800s but more
so starting in the 1920s and 1930s.
It was then that some in the profession began to hone in on
the major complexities and challenges,
social and technological,
involved in <strong>organizing</strong> and <strong>retrieving</strong> information
in order to provide <strong>access</strong>.
The challenges with organizing and retrieving information
that they identified nearly 100 years ago were indeed
major and problematic, but fortuitous,
because it gave rise to what we now called
<em>library science</em>,
the rigorous study of libraries, librarianship, collections,
users, communities, and so forth.</p>
<p>Yet consider when those people laid the groundwork
for a library science nearly 100 years ago,
librarians only managed print and the primary means of
accessing print collections was through a physical building.
With the introduction of computer systems in the 1960s and
with better networking technologies in the 1980s and 1990s,
issues with organizing and retrieving information grew
exponentially, and indeed,
this exponential increase created new complexities and launched
an entire new field, what we now call <em>information science</em>.</p>
<p>All right, back to the ground level.
Let me highlight some key terms in Breeding's article.
They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding aids</li>
<li>Knowledge bases</li>
<li>OpenURL link resolvers</li>
<li>ERM systems</li>
<li>Library service platforms (LSP)</li>
<li>Integrated library systems (ILS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you already have some solid experience
with these things, and even after reading Breeding's
article, these terms may still be abstract.
So, this week, you have two major tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find real, practical examples. Pick one or two of the
above terms and see how they work in practice. Then come
back here and tell us what you found. Use the articles to
help you locate actual products or examples.</li>
<li>Locate how these terms appear in either the Cote and
Ostergaard (2017) article or the Fu and Carmen (2015).
Note other terms that may appear in those two articles
and comment on the role they play in the ERM work flow
and the migration process.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="work-flow"><a class="header" href="#work-flow">Work flow</a></h3>
<p>As you work on this task,
I ask that you pay attention to the emphasis on work flow.
The idea of a <strong>work flow</strong> is a major theme in this course
because it is a major part of
electronic resource management.
We'll come back to the idea over and over this semester.
Also, as we read the Cote and Ostergaard (2017) and
the Fu and Carmen (2015) article,
we will learn about how migrating to new systems is a
major, expensive, and time-consuming project, and
one of the great things about
these two articles is that it documents the work flows
used in these migrations.
If you become involved some day in a migration process,
you should use articles like these to assist you and
to help you make evidence-based decisions about what
you need to accomplish.
And like what these authors have done,
I'd encourage you to document and publish what you learned.
In the print era,
there were some cases where librarians had
to migrate to new systems, too.
For example, some research libraries in the U.S.
started by classifying collections using the
Dewey Decimal Classification system, but
then began to convert to the
Library of Congress Classification system after
the mid-20th century.
This was no small task.
Today, migration is big business in the library world
(see Breeding's site for other examples)
because the technology changes fast and
because there are a number of competing electronic resource
management products that librarians can choose
for their communities,
which they might be inclined to do if the migration
provides an advantage to their users, communities,
and themselves.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="erm-and-ils"><a class="header" href="#erm-and-ils">ERM and ILS</a></h1>
<p>This week we will be learning about ERM and ILS software. First off, what are
these?</p>
<h2 id="ils-the-integrated-library-system"><a class="header" href="#ils-the-integrated-library-system">ILS, the Integrated Library System</a></h2>
<p><strong>ILS</strong> is an acronym for an <strong>integrated library system</strong>. We've also been
introduced to the term <strong>library services platform (LSP)</strong>. Our discussions of
the ILS this week are relevant to those types of an ILS that may also be an
LSP, which are increasingly more common these days.</p>
<p>Regardless, each of you are familiar with an ILS/LSP from a user perspective
and some of you are familiar with these systems from a librarian perspective.
In your lifetimes, you have used an OPAC (online public access catalog) or a
<strong>discovery</strong> interface, you have likely conducted a search for a serial, and
you have most definitely borrowed a print book from a library. These are the
kinds of kinds of functions that an ILS provides for library users.</p>
<p>An ILS also provides an administrative interface that librarians use to manage
those processes. This interface includes functions to manage acquisitions,
cataloging, circulation, and serials, and the OPAC, where the interfaces to
these in the ILS are referred to as <strong>modules</strong>. You should read about these
modules in the open source ILS called <a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen</a> by sifting through
some of Evergreen's documentation.</p>
<p>Hence, the ILS generally provides two separate interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>administrative interface</strong> to be used by librarians to manage the tasks
per the modules</li>
<li>a <strong>public interface</strong> for patrons to access the works of a library</li>
</ul>
<p>Tasks that an ILS provides include modules that cover:</p>
<p>Administrative:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/acquisitions/">Acquisitions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/cataloging/">Cataloging</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/circulation/">Circulation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/serials/">Serials</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Public:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/opac/">OPAC</a> interface</li>
<li><a href="https://scholarship.rollins.edu/as_facpub/138/">Discovery</a> interface </li>
</ul>
<p>An ILS is therefore, as Stephen Salmon stated in 1975, a non-traditional way of
doing traditional things, such as &quot;acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation,&quot;
but which is now fairly traditional! Some librarians who would work with an ILS
include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reference: who use the OPAC or discovery interface</li>
<li>Cataloging and Technical Services: who use the cataloging and serial's
modules and perhaps also the acquisition's module</li>
<li>Circulation: who would use the circulation module
<ul>
<li>Interlibrary Loan department: if such a department exists because the
library is big enough to have one, they would also use the circulation
module</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of those librarians might use multiple modules of the ILS, but might
predominately use one module more frequently than others in their day-to-day
work. For example, when I worked in reference at a small academic library, I
used the Millennium ILS to check out books to users, to fix borrowing issues,
and to search for works in the OPAC. Later I used the cataloging module when I
moved to technical services. However, what a librarian uses frequently depends
on the organizational structure of a library. As our reading by Miller, Sharp,
and Jones (2014) show, the rise in electronic resources has vastly influenced
the ways librarians structure their organizations, whose structure was
originally informed by the dictates of a &quot;print-based world&quot;. In those
structures, librarians may either hold positions where their work is
streamlined and focused on one task, such as collections, or on multiple tasks.</p>

<h2 id="erm-the-electronic-resource-management-system"><a class="header" href="#erm-the-electronic-resource-management-system">ERM, the Electronic Resource Management System</a></h2>
<p>ERM is an acronym for <em>electronic resource management</em> system. Its function is
born out of the need to manage digital assets and provide users with access to
those assets. An ERM may or may not be integrated, as one product, with a
library's ILS software. ERM software is primarily a behind the scenes software.
Similar to the ILS, ERM software is generally divided into modules that focus
the librarian's work on particular duties and allow librarians to create work
flows and knowledge management systems. In an ERM like the open source <a href="http://coral-erm.org/modules/">CORAL
system</a>, the modules includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/resources/">Resources</a>: a module &quot;provides a robust database for
tracking data related to your organization's resources ...&quot; and &quot;provides a
customizable workflow tool that can be used to track, assign, and complete
workflow tasks.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/licensing/">Licensing</a>: a module for a &quot;flexible document management
system&quot; that provides options to manage licensing agreements and to automate
parts of the process.</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/organizations/">Organizations</a>: this module acts as a type of advanced
directory to manage the various organizations that impact or are involved in
the management of electronic resources, including &quot;publishers, vendors,
consortia, and more.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/usage-statistics/">Usage Statistics</a>: a module providing librarians with
usage statistics of digital assets by platform and by publisher. Supports
COUNTER and SUSHI. We'll cover COUNTER and SUSHI later in the semester, but
as a preamble:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/about/counter-for-libraries/">COUNTER</a> &quot;sets and maintains the standard known as the Code of
Practice and ensures that publishers and vendors submit annually to a
rigorous independent audit&quot;, and,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/sushi">SUSHI</a> is a type of protocol to automate collecting data on usage
statistics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/management/">Management</a>: this module provides a document management
system aimed at &quot;storing documents, such as policies, processes, and
procedures, related to the overall management of electronic resources&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our readings this week, we have three articles that speak to ILS and ERM
software as well as the relationship between the two, and an additional article
that offers organizational context. The first reading, by Miller, Sharp, and
Jones (2014) provides some context by describing a case study (the literature
review is also helpful) that shows how electronic resources have impacted
organizational structure, job titles, budgets, and more. The article by
Anderson (2014) lists and describes various ERM solutions. As I mentioned in a
previous lecture, electronic resources is a fast moving area, and even though
this article (or chapter) is a handful of years old, some products are no
longer available, have been merged into others, or sold off. Still, the article
is helpful in describing:</p>
<ul>
<li>the role of vendors in the ERM market</li>
<li>the importance and rise of open source ERMs as well as the mark that various
homegrown solutions have made</li>
<li>related software that plays a role, including:
<ul>
<li>Discovery: federated and indexed</li>
<li>Integrated library systems</li>
<li>Interlibrary loan software</li>
<li>Link resolvers</li>
<li>Ticket management software</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the article by Wang &amp; Dawes (2012), the authors describe the &quot;next
generation integrated library system&quot;, which should meet a few criteria that
include the ability to merge ILS software with ERM software, the latter having
come into creation because of the lack of development among ILS systems, which
were stagnating and not responding to changing work flows and work formats
(i.e., print to electronic) at the time. But around the time the article was
published, more ILS and ERM software began moving to the cloud, as was common
among many software markets. This changed the game, too, because it placed a
bigger burden on software companies to maintain development of the work.</p>
<p>Despite the technical aspects of these solutions, at its basic, both ILS and
ERM software solutions focus on managing assets (books, serials,
<a href="https://archives.yale.edu/subjects/33488">realia</a>, etc) so that librarians can organize and users and librarians
can retrieve them. There's no requirement to use any solution offered by a
library vendor, and that's the point of the Wilson (2011) article, which shows
how regular software can be used to function as a homegrown solution for
creating and implementing an ERM work flow.</p>
<p>In this week's forum, I'll introduce you to the Evergreen ILS and to the CORAL
ERM solution and to its various modules and how they work. Be sure to open the
transcript for this lecture in order to visit the links, especially the
documentation. I ask that you log into these two services using the
instructions on their sites. This will help you get some hands-on experience
with them and also demystify what each do.</p>

<p>Awhile ago now, I conducted some historical research on a librarian named Ralph
Parker. Inspired by technological advances in automation, specifically the use
of the punched cards and machines, Parker began to apply this technology to
library circulation processes in the 1930s and thus became the first person to
automate part of the library's work flow. By the mid-1960s, Parker's decades
long pursuit of library automation led to some major advances, including the
founding of <a href="https://www.oclc.org/">OCLC</a>. Meanwhile, the punched card system he continued to
develop eventually led to massive increases in circulation and better service
to patrons. In the mid-60s he wrote the following about the installation and
launch of a new punched card system to help automate circulation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the delight of the patrons it requires only four seconds to check out
materials (as cited in Burns, 2014).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think about that quote often. When I read that in his annual report in the
archives at the University of Missouri, I could feel his giddiness with these
results. Until this achievement, when a patron borrowed an item from the
library, the process involved completing multiple forms in order to be sure
that accurate records were kept. Accurate record keeping is important.
Libraries need to protect their collections but also provide access to them. As
stated in the <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027387052">Circulation work in public libraries / Jennie M. Flexner
(1927)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is necessary that the library have control of these circulating books in
several ways. It [the library] must know where they are, it must lay down
rules to see that thoughtless people do not retain the books in their
possession unfairly, and it must provide means for securing their prompt
return. These and many other considerations combine to make it necessary for
the [ circulation ] department to install and maintain very efficient methods
to control the circulation of books, which are commonly known as routines (p.
6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What were those routines in the 1930s and thenabouts? Why was Parker so excited
about his system taking only four seconds to check out a work? Well, two
routines are important for circulation. The first involves membership and the
second involves charging or checking out works.</p>
<p>Membership: First, if the patron was not yet a member of a library, then they
had to register to become one; hence, the first routine was to check their
membership and register them as borrowers if they were not yet a member or if
their membership had expired. If this was a public library, then the process
might vary a bit depending if the member was an adult or a youth (or
<em>juveniles</em> in the lingo of the time). Regardless, this routine basically
involved completing an application card, creating a member record and filing
that away for the library's use, and then giving the borrower a card of their
own, i.e., their <strong>borrower's card</strong>.</p>
<p>Charging: Once membership status was confirmed or created, then the circulation
librarian employed a system to <strong>charge</strong> books to the borrower. Several
systems had been employed up through the late 1920s, including the <strong>ledger
system</strong>, the <strong>dummy system</strong>, the <strong>temporary slip system</strong>, the <strong>permanent
slip or card system</strong>, the <strong>Browne system</strong>, and eventually the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Newark%20charging%20system">Newark
charging system</a> (see <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027387052">Flexner, p. 73 and on for
details</a>). Assuming the librarian in the 1930s used the Newark
system, when a book was to be checked out, the librarian needed to enter the
details on a &quot;book card, a date slip and a book pocket for each book&quot; (Flexner,
1927, p. 78). Flexner goes on to outline the process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date slip is pasted opposite the pocket at the back of the book. The date
which indicates when the book is due to be returned or when issued is stamped
on each of three records, the reader's card, the book card and the date slip.
The borrower's number is copied opposite the date on the book card. The date
on the date slip indicates at once the file in which the book card is to be
found, and the [librarian] assistant is able to discharge the book and
release the borrower immediately on the return of the volume (Flexner, 1927,
pp. 78-79).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, circulating books or works to patrons involved a lot of paperwork,
and you can imagine that it might be prone to error. However, the number of
systems at the time show that the processes and routines were increasingly
becoming standardized, and standardization is a necessary pre-requisite to
automation. </p>
<p>Parker's achievement in automation eventually improved the library experience
for patrons as well as the librarians at the circulation desk, and indirectly
their colleagues throughout the library. That is, once circulation standards
stabilized, and once technology like punched cards became available generally,
then it became possible to automate this process for the library. And this was
good; the effects were that automation increased circulation and that an
automated circulation process <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._R._Ranganathan">saved the time of the reader</a>, four
seconds to be exact!</p>
<p>This is all to say that standards and technology go hand and hand and that the
details matter when thinking about standards. How does this relationship work?
Standards enable multiple groups of competing interests to form consensus
around how technology should work, and when this happens, multiple parties
receive payoffs at the expense of any single party acquiring a monopoly. This
is true for the design of screwdrivers, the width of railroad tracks, the
temperature scale, and certainly also to how information is managed and
exchanged. The internet and the web wouldn't exist or definitely not exist as
we know it if not for the standardization of the Internet Protocol (IP), the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
and other internet and web related technologies that enable the internet and
the web to work for so many users regardless of the operating system and the
hardware they use.</p>
<p>Our first article this week is written by Pat Harris and covers the basic
reasons for the existence of <a href="http://www.niso.org/">NISO</a> (the <em>National Information Standards
Organization</em>) and the kinds of standards NISO is responsible for maintaining
and creating. These standards are directly related to libraries and fall under
<a href="https://www.niso.org/welcome-to-niso">three broad categories</a> related to <strong>Information Creation &amp;
Curation</strong>, <strong>Information Discovery &amp; Interchange</strong>, and <strong>Information
Policy &amp; Analysis</strong>. There are standards that touch on bibliographic
information, indexing, abstracting, controlled vocabularies, and many other
library important issues. If you have not before paid attention to NISO, you
might now start seeing more references to the organization and the standards it
publishes, especially because the international library community has worked
closely with NISO to develop standards for various aspects of library work.</p>
<p>Another historical note: As Harris elaborates in the article, NISO came into
existence in the mid-1930s. This was about the same time that Ralph Parker
began working on his punched card system. Not long before this, in the late
1920s, the first library science graduate program launched at the University of
Chicago, and in the early 1930s, the first research based journal started, <em>The
Library Quarterly</em>. We often hear how long libraries have existed, and it's
true that there were quite a few accomplishments before the 1930s, but it is
this time period (for these and a number of other reasons) that marks the
modern era of libraries.</p>
<p>We also are not simply interested in standardizing things like the forms used
to catalog and charge a book, to create member records, to draw up a license
for an electronic resource, as we'll discuss later in the semester. We are also
interested in standardizing, as Flexner would say, &quot;routines&quot;, processes, or
workflows. Thus, our additional readings are on TERMS, or Techniques for
Electronic Resource Management. TERMS is not a true standard, but more of a <em>de
facto</em> standard that helps outline the electronic resource management work
flow. It was developed in order for librarians or others dealing with
electronic resources to come to a consensus on the processes of electronic
resource management. Version 1 of TERMS is described by the TERMS authors in
the <em>Library Technology Reports</em> readings of chapters 1-8. Although it has been
replaced by a <a href="http://6terms.tumblr.com/">newer version</a>, it still functions as a thorough
introduction to the ERM work flow and provides guidance and suggestions on all
aspects of electronic resource management. For example, in <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4738/5647">chapter
7</a> of the LTS report on TERMS version 1, the authors provide very
helpful information on the importance of working with providers or vendors in
case of cancellation of a resource. They write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not burn any bridges! Many resources have postcancellation access, which
means you need to keep up a working relationship with suppliers; this might
also incur a platform access fee going forward, so this needs to be budgeted
for in future years. Review the license to fully understand what your
postcancellation rights to access may be. In addition, you may resubscribe to
the resources in future years. Content is bought and sold by publishers and
vendors. Therefore, you may end up back with your original vendor a year or
two down the line!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of this material is repeated in version 2 of TERMS, but version 2 was
created in order to address changes in the world and to include more input from
the community. Version 2 also includes a slightly modified outline, and
<a href="https://library2.hud.ac.uk/blogs/terms/announcing-terms-ver2-0/terms-ver2-0-introduction/">includes the following parts</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Investigating new content for purchase or addition</li>
<li>Acquiring new content</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Ongoing evaluation and access, and annual review</li>
<li>Cancellation and replacement review</li>
<li>Preservation</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same link just provided, they also write about this new version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the works mentioned or cited in the original TERMS report,
much has been written in the past few years that can help the overwhelmed or
incoming electronic resources librarian manage their daily workflow. In the
end, however, most of the challenges facing the management of electronic
resources is directly related to workflow management. How we manage these
challenging or complex resources is more important than what we do, because
how we do it informs how successful and how meaningful the work is, and how
well it completes our goal of getting access to patrons who want to use these
resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, the outline and the content described in these two versions of TERMS
is very much centered on the ERM work flow. TERMS is essentially a guide and
framework for thinking on the different aspects of the electronic resource
life-cycle within the library, and helps provide librarians with a set of
questions and points of investigation. For example, let's consider Term item 1,
which is to investigate new content for purchase or addition. In a presentation
by the <a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/19420/">Emery and Stone (2014)</a>, they suggest that this involves the
following steps, partly paraphrased:</p>
<ul>
<li>outline what you want to achieve</li>
<li>create a specification document</li>
<li>assemble the right team</li>
<li>review the market and literature and set up trial</li>
<li>speak with suppliers and vendors</li>
<li>make a decision (Emery and Stone, slide 12, 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>Emery and Stone provide other examples, and the TERMS listed in this slide are
from the first version. TERM 6, PRESERVATION, was added in version 2, and TERMS
4 and 5 from version 1 were joined together. There is a link to these
<a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/19420/">slides</a>, with further examples, in the transcript of this lecture, as
well as the citation.</p>
<p>This week you have a two part exercise:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you will visit the NISO website and search for documentation on a
standard, recommended practices, or technical reports and post about it. The
differences between these publications follows:</p>
<p><strong>Technical reports:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NISO Technical Reports provide useful information about a particular topic,
but do not make specific recommendations about practices to follow. They are
thus &quot;descriptive&quot; rather than &quot;prescriptive&quot; in nature. Proposed standards
that do not result in consensus may get published as technical reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommended Practices:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NISO Recommended Practices are &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;guidelines&quot; for methods,
materials, or practices in order to give guidance to the user. These
documents usually represent a leading edge, exceptional model, or proven
industry practice. All elements of Recommended Practices are discretionary
and may be used as stated or modified by the user to meet specific needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <strong>Published and Approved NISO Standards</strong> are the final, approved
definitions that have been achieved by a consensus of the community.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards">https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards</a></p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, after reading about TERMS, try to place these TERMS in additional
electronic resource management context. Please draw from your experience last
week using the ILS and ERM software, from the readings, your personal work
experience in a library, if you have that, or use your imagination.
Specifically, it would be interesting if you could pick out aspects of systems
like Coral and Folio that appear to facilitate standardized workflows.</p>
<p>I am requiring a lot of reading this week because these readings capture the
specifics of the ERM work flow, and understanding them will help you get
started and attain success in this position. The Rinck article is a good
interview with the authors of TERMS. Consider this optional reading, but its
still worthy of your time.</p>

<p><strong>Note to self:</strong> see content at bottom to incorporate into next year's lecture.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week we cover interoperability and link resolvers.</p>
<p>Before this discussion gets complicated, remember that the fundamental idea of
link resolvers is that link resolvers resolve links. They are a technical
solution to help users of electronic resources access the full text in a
library's collection based on a citation discovered in a search result, an
article's list of references, or wherever else the link resolver might show up.
It is meant to work for all items in a library's collection. Its reason for
existence is for items that are pay-walled or for items that are inaccessible
via the open web. Link resolvers are also used to acquire access through some
other means, like inter-library loan, and though its use is motivated by
electronic resources, it can identify resources that are located in the library
stacks since such items will have a link (or a URL) in the online catalog or
discovery system.</p>
<p>To get an idea of how they work, let's imagine a search in <em>Google Scholar</em>,
and as a result of this search, we have identified a non-open-access article
that we wish to retrieve from the library's electronic resources. If you have
made <em>Google Scholar</em> aware that you are affiliated with a specific library and
if the library uses a link resolver service, then:</p>
<ol>
<li>The metadata about the article will be extracted from <em>Google Scholar</em>, or
the <em>source</em>, and this will be added to</li>
<li>the metadata about the institution (administrative metadata, like an
institutional ID number).</li>
<li>The metadata is converted into a URL query that queries the library's
collections, and</li>
<li>the user is then presented with <em>target</em> options (or taken directly to the
work) for retrieving the article, and the options may include full text
access from various and possibly multiple vendors or publishers, information
about the physical location (e.g., on the shelves) if it exists, or options
to request the work through inter-library loan. Ideally, it will lead the
user directly to the full text.</li>
</ol>
<p>[ Show how to make <em>Google Scholar</em> aware of your affiliation ]</p>
<p>See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140419201741/http://lj.libraryjournal.com:80/2004/04/ljarchives/the-lure-of-linking/#LinkResolver">Link Resolver 101</a> for additional details and this historical
piece on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140419201741/http://lj.libraryjournal.com:80/2004/04/ljarchives/the-lure-of-linking/">link resolvers</a>.</p>
<p>Consider a basic keyword search in <em>Google Scholar</em> for the term <code>electronic resources</code>. One of the first items listed in the results page is to an article
titled &quot;Electronic resources: access and usage at Ashesi University College.&quot;
If we've gone to <em>Google Scholar's</em> settings, and added your library to the
<strong>Library Links</strong> list, then we should see a <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link to the
right of your search result list. This indicates the likelihood, although there
could be an error, that the article is available through UK Libraries, in my
case, or another library in another person's case.</p>
<p>Let's compare the URL that <em>Google Scholar</em> provides to access the first result
with the URL via the <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link. We can examine both URLs by
right-clicking them and decomposing them into their components.</p>
<p>The URL for the direct source is:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/10650740510632208/full/html
</code></pre>
<p>This URL contains the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>https:// : indicates the secure hypertext protocol</li>
<li>www      : indicates the subdomain</li>
<li>emerald.com : indicates the first and second level domain names</li>
<li>/insight/content/doi : the general location in the directory on the
emerald.com server that contains this article</li>
<li>/10.1108/10650740510632208 : also part of the location in the directory on
emerald.com, but in this case, this is location is more unique to the journal
and the article</li>
<li>/full/html : more location about where the item is located on emerald.com</li>
</ul>
<p>The DOI for this article is specifically <code>10.1108/10650740510632208</code> and is
composed of a <a href="https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html">prefix and suffix</a>. The prefix includes the
following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 : this is the directory indicator</li>
<li>1108 : the registrant code for this specific journal</li>
</ul>
<p>The suffix refers to the following element:</p>
<ul>
<li>10650740510632208 : a character string (in this case, of numbers) that refers
to the article. This string is created by the registrant</li>
</ul>
<p>When we view the <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link, we see what's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">query
string</a>. A query string is a part of the URL that contains
(metadata) fields or parameters and values for those parameters, and it begins
with the first ampersand and after the letter <em>q</em> in the URL. Each additional
parameter begins after each ampersand. In the following query string, I start
each newline with a new parameter and end it with its value just to make the
URL components easier to see:</p>
<pre><code>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?
output=instlink&amp;
q=info:Sj_9YmD0RWYJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;
hl=en&amp;
as_sdt=0,18&amp;
scillfp=9038251622808028378&amp;
oi=lle
</code></pre>
<p>According to a source that describes <a href="https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-api">Google Scholar's
API</a>, some of the parameters above mean the following
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>output: &quot;Parameter defines the final output you want. It can be set to json (default) to get a structured JSON of the results, or html to get the raw html retrieved.&quot; Here, <strong>instlink</strong> refers to <strong>institional link</strong>, but that's a guess.</li>
<li>q: &quot;Parameter defines the query you want to search. You can also use helpers in your query such as: author:, or source:&quot; Here, my guess is that this refers to Google Scholar's own citation ID for this work.</li>
<li>hl: &quot;Parameter defines the language to use for the Google search. It's a two-letter language code.&quot;</li>
<li>as_sdt: &quot;Parameter can be used either as a search type or a filter.&quot; Here the 18 refers to Kentucky, but the 0 part, I believe, indicates that the query <a href="https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-courts">should not return results</a> from court cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to those parameters, if we click on that <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link, we are now
transported to UK's discovery service, <em>Primo</em>, by <em>Ex Libris</em>. This means that
the URL is the effective point of data exchange between Google Scholar and UK's
resources.</p>
<p>In our example, there is only one service that provides access to this work,
and that means the Primo hands off our query to UK Library's proxy service,
<strong>EZProxy</strong>, which takes us to a copy of that full text.</p>
<p>But if more resources provided access, like both EBSCOhost and ProQuests
databases, we would stop on Primo and be offered to select which database we
would like to view the full text.</p>
<p>In our case, since we only have one option, the Primo to EZProxy transfer
happens quickly, and but I was able to save the Primo URL. If we investigate
this URL, we see that it's an OpenURL link, and we can see the fields and
values and identify the metadata (I have decomposed the URL for readability).
The percent signs and numbers in the title field use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">Percent-encoding</a>, and they convert characters that are URL
unfriendly, like empty spaces between words, to something that URLs can handle
and parse. See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp">this page</a> for a table of UTF-8 percent-encodings and
the characters they match:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The link resolver technology works and translates the metadata as needed for
the appropriate service.</p>
<p>We can see another instance of this within Primo itelf. Here I search for the
phrase <code>electronic resources</code> and then filter by WorldCat options. The first
option is a work titled <strong>Electronic Resources. Selection and bibliographic
control.</strong> This is not available via UK Libraries, and so I would have to
request the item through interlibrary loan. If I do that for the main campus,
then the URL becomes this. Note that these are essentially metadata elements
and that some elements are empty even though they are present in the URL:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This all works because the various publishers and vendors, and their associated
applications, have agreed to use this technology.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example a database that a library subscribes to, like
EBCOHost's <em>Academic Search Complete (ASC)</em>. I search for the term <code>knowledge management</code>. ASC is an abstracting and indexing, bibliographic database that
provides access to some full text articles on its own platform, whereas <em>Google
Scholar</em> links to full text, only if it is freely available on the web, or
links to them via a link resolver, if the <em>Google Scholar</em> user has set this up
in their settings, and the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/libraries.html">library has also configured this on their
side</a>.</p>
<p>For those bibliographic records that are not available as full text in ASC, the
link resolver used by UK Libraries will display an option underneath the
bibliographic record in the ASC results or it will display after clicking the
full display option of the record. Here we see the link resolver in action in
the form of the <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> button. Clicking that will open the link
resolver menu, and we will see a list of options for accessing the full text of
the article. If the article is available full text in the library, like through
a different database. If not, there should be options for requesting the item
through inter-library loan or options for accessing the item in the library's
physical collections if the library has the item in the stacks.</p>
<h2 id="link-resolvers-in-practice"><a class="header" href="#link-resolvers-in-practice">Link Resolvers in Practice</a></h2>
<p>Our readings this week by Kasprowski (2012) and by Chisari et al. (2017)
discuss link resolver technology and methods to evaluate link resolver
technology. It may not be necessary to learn how to hack your way through the
OpenURL syntax or other aspects of link resolver URL formatting, but it is a
good idea to acquire a basic understanding of how the URLs work in this
process.</p>
<p>Let me re-emphasize that the key way that link resolvers work is by embedding
citation metadata within the link resolver URL, including administrative
metadata. This is another reason to have high quality metadata for our records,
as our readings note. By implication, if we find, perhaps by an email from a
library patron, that a link has broken in this process, it might be that the
metadata is incorrect or has changed in some important way. Knowing the parts
of this process aids us in deciphering possible errors that exist when the
technology breaks.</p>
<p>For this week, I'll provide a link to <em>ExLibres Alma</em> link resolver
documentation, which is the link resolver product used by UK Libraries. Let's
discuss this documentation in the forum. I want you to find and explain other
instances of link resolvers. Be sure to provide links to these examples and
articulate ways the technology can be evaluated.</p>

<h2 id="openurl"><a class="header" href="#openurl">OpenURL</a></h2>
<p>My university's library uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL">OpenURL</a>
and Primo/Alma's discovery service/link resolver to request sources via various
bibliographic databases. Or more accurately, the university library uses
Primo/Alma, which uses an OpenURL compatible link resolver.</p>
<p>Basically, the technology is meant to help library users gain access to a
library's (usually paywalled) electronic resources (or locate items in the
catalog). E.g., if you're searching on Google Scholar and you see a <strong>View Now
@ [YOUR LIBRARY]</strong> link next to a search result, and you click on that link,
then you are using, or triggering, a link resolver to request the source. As a
library user, you have to add your institution in Google Scholar via their
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_settings?sciifh=1&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,18#2">settings</a>,
but if you're using a bibliographic or citation database directly provided by
your library, then it should be available by default.</p>
<p>Because OpenURL compatible link resolver technology is partly based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">query
strings</a>, it's fun to glean all
sorts of information by examining the URL: the query string component that
contains the metadata for the source but also the base component that contains
the vendor and institutional information and also the URL type. Namely, it
turns out that Primo/Alma uses two URL types to request resources: a search URL
and an OpenURL. At my institution, the base search URL looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?
</code></pre>
<p>The base OpenURL differs just a bit (see the end of the URL):</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?
</code></pre>
<p>The base search URL appears when searching the university's online catalog (or
discovery service). However, the OpenURL appears only in transit between the
original resource and before reaching the final source; e.g., after clicking on
a <strong>View Now @</strong> link and before being redirected to the full text version of
the article that might be available at the original location (an open access
location) or via the proxy location (e.g.,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EZproxy">EZproxy</a>). Because the redirect happens
quickly, I had to quickly copy my institution's specific OpenURL when I clicked
on a <strong>View Now</strong> link before it redirected to the EZproxy page.</p>
<p>My students often identify great problems to solve or are the source of great
ideas. One of my students in my <a href="https://github.com/cseanburns/electronic_resource_mgmt">electronic resource management
class</a> noticed that
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> has a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/locate">locate
menu</a> that uses OpenURL resolvers to
look up items in a library. By default, Zotero uses WorldCat, but it can use a
specific institution's OpenURL resolver, too. I had completely forgotten about
this. I think I stopped trying to use it years ago because the WorldCat default
stopped working. Anyway, when I investigated, I noticed that my institution
wasn't available via Zotero or listed on their page of <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/locate/openurl_resolvers">OpenURL
resolvers</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn't know what my institution's exact OpenURL was, but I was
able to figure it out by comparing the syntax and values from other Primo URLs
listed on Zotero's page of OpenURL resolvers and because I had just written a
lecture on link resolvers. So by comparing OpenURLs and by using the info from
my lecture, where I had discussed the components of link resolver URLs, I was
able to derive my institution's specific OpenURL (base component plus
institutional info), which is:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?institution=01SAA_UKY&amp;vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY
</code></pre>
<p>I added that to Zotero, and it worked, and then I posted the OpenURL info to
Zotero's forum, and they've added it to their OpenURL resolver page. That's
pretty cool.</p>
<p>If anyone who comes across this post and is curious about how to add this info
to Zotero, <a href="https://library.sacredheart.edu/zotero/advanced/usingLibraryLookup">another
library</a>
has created a video on this. The directions cover adding a specific OpenURL to
Zotero and on how to use Zotero's Library Lookup functionality.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="electronic-access"><a class="header" href="#electronic-access">Electronic Access</a></h1>
<p>As I've stated in previous lecture, <strong>Access</strong> is the paramount principle of
librarianship, and all other issues, from censorship to information retrieval
or to usability, within LIS, are on some level derived from or framed by that
principle of <strong>Access</strong>.</p>
<p>This week, then, we devote ourselves to a discussion of <strong>electronic access</strong>,
and it is helpful to begin with Samples and Healy (2014), who provide a nice
framework for thinking about managing electronic access. They include two broad
categories, <em>proactive troubleshooting</em> and <em>reactive troubleshooting</em> of
access.</p>
<ul>
<li>proactive troubleshooting of access: &quot;defined as troubleshooting access
problems before they are identified by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;letting public-facing library staff know about planned database
downtime&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;doing a complete inventory to make sure that every database paid for is
in fact 'turned on'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reactive troubleshoot of access: &quot;defined as troubleshooting access issues as
problems are identified and reported by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;fixing broken links&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;fixing incorrect coverage date ranges in the catalog&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;patron education about accessing full text&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal here, as suggested by Samples and Healy (2014), is to maximize
proactive troubleshooting and to minimize reactive troubleshooting. Or, to
prevent problems from happening. Samples and Healy's report is a great example
of why we call the field <em>library science</em>. The purpose of making librarianship
a science was based on a need to rigorize librarianship, to systematically
study the problems of libraries, and to generalize solutions based on
systematic study. The project they describe does that nicely. The authors
identified a problem that had grown &quot;organically,&quot; collected and analyzed data,
and then generalized from it by outlining a &quot;detailed workflow&quot; to &quot;improve the
timeliness and accuracy of electronic resource work.&quot; Practically, studies like
this promise to improve productivity and better work flows that foster job and
patron satisfaction. It could also help librarians identify the kinds of
software solutions that will align with their workflows and patron information
behaviors. If interested, you might want to read a recent article in the
<em>Journal of Electronic Resource Librarianship</em> about the impact of Covid-19 on
electronic resource management. Six authors individually describe access issues
at their respective institutions and show how issues of pricing, acquisitions,
training, user expectations, and budgets affect electronic access. It is good
to read articles like this in light of the framework provided by Samples and
Healy (2014) because stories like these, about this impact of the pandemic on
electronic access, could help guide us in developing proactive troubleshooting
procedures that will minimize issues in the future, pandemic or not, at our own
institutions.</p>
<p>Lowe, R. A., Chirombo, F., Coogan, J. F., Dodd, A., Hutchinson, C., &amp; Nagata,
J. (2021). Electronic Resources Management in the Time of COVID-19: Challenges
and Opportunities Experienced by Six Academic Libraries. <em>Journal of Electronic
Resources Librarianship, 33</em>(3), 215–223.
https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2021.1949162</p>
<p>Back to Samples and Healy (2014), who say something important against a common
assumption about electronic resources, particularly those provided by vendors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impression that once a resource is acquired, it is then just 'accessible'
belies the actual, shifting nature of electronic resources, where continual
changes in URLs, domain names, or incompatible metadata causes articles and
ebooks to be available one day, but not the next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, unlike a printed work from the long ago print-only era that, once
cataloged, may be shelved for decades or longer without major problems of
access, electronic resources require constant and active attention to maintain
accessibility to them. Ebooks, for example, can create metadata problems. Often
what's important about scholarly ebooks, in particular, are the chapters they
include, and hence metadata describing ebook components is important, along
with providing links to those chapters in discovery systems. This difference
between item-level cataloging and title-level cataloging, as Samples and Healy
describe, can lead to confusing and problematic results when considering
different genres and what those genres contain. Or, note that they discuss how
a series of links are involved starting from the source of discovery, e.g., an
OPAC, to the retrieved item, and how difficult it might be in determining which
of these links and which of those services is broken when access becomes
problematic.</p>
<p>Let me highlight a few key findings from their report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflows: why does this keep coming up? It's because workflows help automate
a process---simplify and smooth out what needs to be done, and because this
is only possible when things are standardized.</li>
<li>Staffing: we'll discuss this more in a future forum, but part of the problem
here is that ERM has had a major impact on organizational structure, but one
where different libraries have responded differently. This lack of
organizational standardization has its benefits regarding overall management
practices and cultures, but it also has huge drawbacks---and that's the
difficulty in establishing effective, generalized workflows that include key
participants, and to minimize as many dependencies on any one person.</li>
<li>Tracking: if there's no tracking, there's no method to systematically
identify patterns in problems. And if that's not possible, then there's no
method to solve those problems proactively. It's just all reactive, and
reactive troubleshooting, as Samples and Healy indicate, results in poor
patron experiences. We'll discuss tracking when we during the week on
Evaluation and Statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the Carter and Traill (2017) article because we commonly get the line
that discovery systems are a great solution to all the disparate discipline
based resources that librarians subscribe to in order to search their
collections. Or, if we do think about problems with such systems, we are often
presented with a basic information retrieval problem, such that the larger the
collection to search, the more likely a relevant item will get lost in the mix.
But as Carter and Traill (2017) point out, these discovery systems also tend to
reveal access problems as they are used. The authors provide a checklist, as a
result of their analysis, to track issues and improve existing workflows.</p>
<p>The Buhler and Cataldo (2016) article provides an important reminder that the
mission of the electronic resource librarian is to serve the patron. This
should remind us that the internet and the web have flattened genres, and have
made it difficult to distinguish among things like magazine articles, news
articles, journal articles, encyclopedia articles, ebooks, etc. Though the
Buhler and Cataldo (2016) reading is student-focused, other studies have hinted
at the same issue they describe across other populations. It's important, if
possible, to recognize these issues as ERM librarians and work to resolve them
in the ways that you would be able to.</p>
<p>I grew up with some understanding of the differences between an encyclopedia
article, a journal article, a magazine article, a newspaper article, a chapter
in a book, a handbook, an index, a dictionary, etc. because I grew up with the
printed versions and because these were tangible things that looked different.
Today, a traditional first year college student was born around the year 2003
and grew up reading around the turn of the first decade. The problem this
raises is that although electronic resources are electronic or digital, they
are still based on genres that originated in the print age, yet they lack the
physical characteristics that help distinguish one from the other. E.g., what's
the difference between a longer <em>NY Times</em> article (traditionally a newspaper
article) and an article in the <em>New Yorker</em> (traditionally a magazine article)
today? Aside from some aesthetic differences between the two, they are both web
pages, and it's not altogether obvious, based on any kind of cursory
examination, that we can tell, as regular users, that they're entirely
different genres. However, there are important informational differences
between the two, how they were written, how they were edited, who they were
written by that might still lead us to consider them as different genres. Even
<em>Wikipedia</em> articles pose this problem. Citing an encyclopedia article was
never an accepted practice, but this was only true for general encyclopedias.
It was generally okay to cite articles from special encyclopedias because they
focused on limited subject matters like specific areas of art, music, science,
culture, and were usually more in-depth in their coverage. Examples include the
<em>Encyclopedia of GIS</em>, the <em>Encyclopedia of Evolution</em>, <em>The Kentucky African
American Encyclopedia</em>, <em>The Encyclopedia of Virtual Art Carving
Toraja--Indonesia</em>, and so forth. There are some studies that show that
<em>Wikipedia</em> does provide that kind of in-depth coverage of some subject
matters, thus helping to flatten the encyclopedia genre, too.</p>
<p>The flattening holds true for things like <em>Google</em>. The best print analogy for
<em>Google</em> is that of an index, which was used to locate keywords that would
point to source material. See the links in the discussion post for examples.
The main difference between these indexes and <em>Google</em> is that the indexes were
produced to cover specific publications, like a newspaper, or specific areas,
like the <em>Social Science Citation Index</em> or the <em>Science Citation Index</em>, both
of which are actual, documented, historical precursors to <em>Google</em> and to
<em>Google Scholar</em>. But, today, these search engines are erroneously considered
source material (e.g, &quot;I found it on Google&quot;). Few, I think, would have
considered a print index as source material, but rather as a <strong>reference</strong>
item, since it <em>referred</em> users to sources. Now it's all mixed up, but who can
blame anyone.</p>
<p>Let's discuss all of this on the board.</p>

<p>If all goes according to plan, this week's readings on electronic resource
management and on workflow analysis should help put prior material into context
and act as a bridge to the material we will discuss in much of the remaining
weeks of the semester.</p>
<p>In the first three weeks of the semester, we learned about and discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>what it means to be a librarian who oversees or is a part of electronic resource management,</li>
<li>what kinds of criteria are sought for in new hires, and</li>
<li>why electronic resources have introduced so much <em>constant disruption</em> across libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>This latter point is largely due to, among other things, the fact that the
print-era involved largely (or at least more so) a linear process of collection
management that was fundamentally altered with the introduction of electronic
resources.</p>
<p>Then we discussed the differences between:</p>
<ul>
<li>electronic resource management software and</li>
<li>integrated library system software. </li>
</ul>
<p>We also learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical and workflow standards</li>
</ul>
<p>And we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>why both types of the above standards are important,</li>
<li>why interoperability is required, and</li>
<li>what happens when access to electronic resources break.</li>
</ul>
<p>This week things will start to make connections at a faster pace. In the first
Anderson article (chapter 2), we gain a clearer idea of what a knowledge base
is and how it works, and we learn more about how integrated library systems and
ERM systems work together (or fail to). We also dip our toes into newer topics
like licensing, COUNTER, and SUSHI, which we'll cover in greater detail in the
next few weeks.</p>
<p>In the second Anderson article (chapter 3), we learn how to take careful
consideration of a library's work flow before selecting which ERM software to
purchase. This is why workflow based standards are important, even if they are
not true technical standards. We do this because we select systems based on the
needs of the librarians, which may be vastly different across libraries, and
which must rely on different aspects of the overall process. As you read this
chapter, I want you to keep in mind the Samples and Healy article from the
previous week's reading.</p>
<p>As hinted at in these readings, especially in the section on acquisitions,
budget, subscription, and purchasing in chapter two but also in the multiple
discussions about the role vendors play in electronic resource management, the
market and the economics of this area of librarianship weigh heavily on
everyday realities. We will follow up on this next week when we begin to read
more about the market and the economics of electronic resources. For example,
in our Anderson readings this week, we learn about the CORE recommended
practice (RP), or the <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/core-cost-resource-exchange">Cost of Resource Exchange</a>, that was
developed by NISO. CORE brings together three aspects of our previous
discussions: software, funds, and interoperability. Here the CORE RP describes
how the ILS and ERM systems can communicate the costs of electronic resources
between each other. Its existence hints at the pressures librarians have had in
having to deal with complex budget issues. Although this is not touched on in
these articles, the current pandemic will make these issues more complicated
for libraries.</p>
<p>While we spent time discussing technical standards, we also learned about
TERMS, an attempt to standardize the language and processes involved with
electronic resource management. We see more connections in this week's
readings. Aside from the CORE standard, we learn more about standard attempts
at licensing, and the <em>COUNTER</em> and <em>SUSHI</em> statistic-related standards, which
provide standards for the communication, collection, presentation, and the
formatting of usage statistics for electronic resources such as ebooks,
journals, databases, and more.</p>
<p>We have also discussed interoperability, and what it takes for multiple systems
to connect and transfer content between each other. We primarily discussed this
with respect to link resolver technology, and we did this not just because we
should know about link resolvers as important components of electronic resource
management, but also because link resolvers are a good example of the kind of
work that is involved for systems to communicate properly. There are other
forms of interoperability, though, and coming back to <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/core-cost-resource-exchange">CORE</a>
again, the Anderson article (chapter 2) provides a link to a white paper
titled, <a href="https://old.diglib.org/standards/ERMI_Interop_Report_20080108.pdf">White Paper on Interoperability between Acquisitions Modules of
Integrated Library Systems and Electronic Resource Management
Systems</a>, and this paper defines the 13 data elements that were
determined to be desired in any exchange between ILS software and ERM software
for these software to communicate usefully with each other. By that, I mean,
the data points enable meaningful use of both the ILS software and the ERM
software, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>purchase order number</li>
<li>price</li>
<li>start/end dates</li>
<li>vendor</li>
<li>vendor ID</li>
<li>invoice number</li>
<li>fund code</li>
<li>invoice date</li>
<li>selector</li>
<li>vendor contact information</li>
<li>purchase order note</li>
<li>line item note</li>
<li>invoice note (White Paper ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>That white paper contains example and worthwhile use cases and stories from
major libraries, and these cases are rather helpful reads. You are not required
to read this paper, but I urge you to skim through it to get a sense of how
standards are created through a process of comparing and contrasting and
coordinating needs and contexts among different entities. The link is in the
transcript but also in the reading, as well as the link to the actual <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/core-cost-resource-exchange">CORE
protocol</a>:</p>
<p>I really like our two readings by Anderson because they are illustrative of the
whole ERM process. If you are able, visit the issue these two readings are from
and read the other chapters that Anderson has written.</p>
<p>In short, this week's topic will also, if all goes well, help provide a
foundation for the remaining weeks, when we will learn about and discuss things
like licensing and negotiation and evaluation and statistics in more detail.
Think of this week as a transition between the first part of the semester and
what happens next.</p>

<h2 id="copyright-and-budgets"><a class="header" href="#copyright-and-budgets">Copyright and Budgets</a></h2>
<p>This week we're reading a piece on the ebook market (Sanchez, 2015), and one on
the academic journal market (Bosch, Albee, &amp; Henderson, 2018). We'll learn how
each impacts library budgets.</p>
<p>To understand Sanchez's article, we need to address some copyright topics. In
the next part of this lecture, I'll discuss copyright, the first sale doctrine,
and show how digital works have disrupted some basic ways that libraries
function. The article by Bosch, Albee, and Henderson discusses a similar case
among academic libraries, but with academic or scholarly journals as the focal
point. I'll address some of the citation metrics they discuss.</p>
<h3 id="copyright"><a class="header" href="#copyright">Copyright</a></h3>
<p>Copyright law grants a monopoly to the person or corporate owner of an
intellectual property. That is, the copyright owner has exclusive rights over
the material that they own, where <em>they</em> could be a person or an organizational
entity. Section 106 of the law grants copyright owners the following rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;</p>
<p>(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;</p>
<p>(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;</p>
<p>(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the
copyrighted work publicly;</p>
<p>(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the
individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display
the copyrighted work publicly; and</p>
<p>(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly
by means of a digital audio transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106">Copyright Section 106</a></p>
<p>These exclusive rights are all encompassing, and intentionally designed to
allow copyright owners a monopoly of their property. In principle and under
some constraints, this is a good thing. However, there are some implications
that we should consider.</p>
<p>In short, if those exclusive rights were followed without limitations, then it
would mean that the exchange of money for a work between a copyright holder and
a buyer for something like a printed book or a DVD would not entail a transfer
of ownership of that physical copy; that is, it would not allow the buyer of
the physical item any distribution rights of the item once the first exchange
has been made. Under such a scenario, libraries would be able to buy physical
books but would not be able to lend them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/">First Sale Doctrine</a> helps avoid the issue granted by the
full-blown list of exclusive rights granted by copyright ownership. Because of
the first sale doctrine, made a precedent in the early 20th century and then
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#109">codified into law in 1976</a>, you, I, or a library may buy a physical
copy of a work, like a book, a DVD, a painting, and literally own that specific
copy. First sale doctrine does not grant us reproduction rights, as they are
listed in Section 106 of the copyright law, but it does allow us to distribute
the singular, physical representation or embodiment of the work that we have
purchased. Thus, this first sale doctrine is why libraries were able to thrive
throughout the 20th century, lend material, and preserve it. More mundanely,
it's also why I can buy a book at a bookstore and later give it away or sell it
to someone after I've finished it.</p>
<p>The digital medium makes things messier, as it tends to do. There are two big
reasons for this. First, digital works are not subject to the same
distributions constraints that physical works are subject to, and the first
sale doctrine is about distribution rights and not reproduction rights. If I
have a physical copy of some book and give you my copy of that book, then I no
longer have that copy. However, if I have a copy of a digital file, then as we
all know, it's relatively trivial for me to share that file with you without
losing access to my own copy. Since digital works can be copied and distributed
without anyone losing access to their copies or even to the original, the First
Sale Doctrine does not apply. In the digital space, there are far fewer
limitations on supply, including on lending.</p>
<p>Second, many digital works are like software, or at least, they are fully
intertwined with the software needed to display them. This is true for all
kinds of documents, like HTML pages, which need a web browser or text editor to
read them and perhaps also other technologies, like JavaScript; or audio files,
which need some a media player to listen to them. But let's consider ebooks as
an example. Ebooks arrive in all shapes and sizes. Project Gutenberg
distributes ebooks that are in the public domain and in various file formats
that include plain text documents that have no presentation markup like bold,
italics, and like, HTML documents with markup, XML documents like EPUB, and
then also PDFs and others. Why so many file formats? Text is text, right, and
in the print space, a book is simply printed on a page, even if it's sometimes
printed on different sized pages or using different type settings. But these
various markups exist because they each offer technological or presentational
advantages and are often tied to specific pieces of software.</p>
<p>This is especially true for proprietary file formats, like the ones that Amazon
created for use only on Kindles, or the popular MP3 file format for audio
recordings that only recently became patent free. While file formats like these
may not be necessarily counted as software, depending on how we define
software, but more like data structures, it is certainly true that file formats
and the specific software applications that display can be completely
intertwined. If you are old enough, you may remember the headaches caused with
files created as <strong>.doc</strong> in some early version of Microsoft Word that later
failed to display properly in a future Microsoft Word version or in some other
word document software. WordPerfect 5.1 was a popular word processing
applications in the 1990s, and it's not clear if files created with that
application, or other popular word processing applications at that time, would
open today, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/%7Eem36/wpdos/wptoword.html">at least without intervention</a>.</p>
<p>In short, these complexities introduce obstacles to the first sale doctrine and
raise other copyright issues because of the connection to software, which is
also often copyrighted. The result is that copyright holders and publishers
have little financial interest in selling actual digital copies of works, since
they cannot prevent future distribution without special technologies, and
instead are more motivated to license material and sometimes explicitly tie
that material to specific pieces of software and hardware, like the Kindle,
which would have to be bought, and that adds additional expense.</p>
<p>What does this mean for libraries in the digital age? It means that libraries
buy less and rent or license more, and renting means that they continually pay
for something for as long as they want access to it. As Sanchez (2015) puts it,
&quot;At its simplest, this takes the form of paying x dollars per year per title
during the length of the contract.&quot; When the total supply of works increases,
e.g., the total number of published books increases, as they do each year, then
it means renting more and more without ever completely acquiring. When budgets
are cut or are stagnant, this ultimately means a decline in the collection a
library has to offer, or if not a decline in the collection, then cuts in some
other areas of a library, like the number of librarians or other staff. This is
the conundrum that Sanchez raises in his article.</p>
<p>If that alone were the issue, maybe librarians could discern other sustainable
ways to proceed, but Sanchez raises additional issues and questions: what if
publishers raise the prices for digital content at an annual rate faster than
what they already raise for print content (reasonable assumption)? If so, does
that mean that librarians will be able to afford fewer titles, digital or
print, unless they raise their budgets, and, as they weed, how would that
impact the physical space of the library? See figure 2.3, specifically, from
Sanchez's article. The plot shows just how much could be lost and how little
gained if the forecasts Sanchez discusses come true.</p>
<p>Keep all of this in mind as you process Sanchez's article. You can even connect
it to some discussions you've already had about accessing digital content.
Specifically, there are many ways to put constraints on the supply of an item
in the digital landscape, as opposed to limiting supply in the physical space,
which include fewer methods. That is, it's relatively easy for publishers and
others to restrict the supply of physical works. They simply have to limit how
many of those physical works are manufactured (e.g., the number of print runs).
But given the nature of digital content, restricting supply is driven by the
technologies available to do so, and since there are so many publishers and
distribution points, then each one of these points will often create their own
unique type of constraint on the supply. The result is that there will be a
number of confusing methods implemented to limit constraint, even if these
limitations are marketed as selling points. In practice, this may mean that
only a limited number of people may &quot;check&quot; out a work from a library at one
time, or access a database at one time, and so forth. Thus, the budget issue
has an impact on access and usability.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the last time I taught this course, I reached out to Joseph Sanchez
and interviewed him. Please enjoy the interview! It's long but it was a very
fun exchange.</p>

<p>Although ebooks likely represent the biggest impact on public library budgets,
academic libraries are largely concerned with scholarly journals. Like Sanchez
(2015), Bosch, Albee, &amp; Henderson (2018) show that the major issue here is that
academic library budgets are declining or holding flat, even though prices
continue to increase for journal titles and though the number of published
articles increase. This raises an interesting phenomenon---that although
researchers are hurt by the lack of access to research, researchers are also
part of the cause of the increase simply because they continue to publish more
and more. Ironically, the result of that rate of increase is less access for
many.</p>
<p>The authors also note that part of the drive to publish includes a drive to
publish in so-called <em>prestigious</em> journal titles, where <em>prestigious</em> is
determined by how well cited the title is. The authors refer to a few
citation-based metrics that the research community uses to determine prestige.
These include the long-established <em>Impact Factor</em>, which can be examined in
the <em>Journal Citation Reports</em> (JCR) provided by Clarivate Analytics, as well
as newer ones, such as the <em>Eigenfactor</em> and the <em>Article Influence Score</em>,
which can also be examined in JCR (the eigenfactor.org site is not well
updated, at the time of this writing).</p>
<p>One motivation for using a citation metric as the basis of evaluating journal
titles is because citation metrics indicate, at some level, the use of the
title. That is, a citation to an article in a journal title means, ideally,
that the authors citing that article have read the article. Historically, when
Eugene Garfield invented the <em>Impact Factor</em>, it was partly so as a tool for
librarians to use in collection management because he recognized this use-based
theory of citations.</p>
<p>However, citation metrics should never be the sole or even primary tool for
such purposes, though. While they may provide good information, there are many
caveats. First, there are different fields of research, and some fields cite at
different rates and at different volumes than other fields, and also for
different reasons. This is why, in Table 5 of the Bosch, Albee, and Henderson
(2018) article, the cost per cite for journals in the Philosophy &amp; Religion
category are so much higher that the cost per cite of titles in other
categories. Authors in P&amp;R simply have different citation and publishing
behaviors than authors in other categories. Second, citations do not capture
all uses of a journal. For example, there are many journal titles that I might
use in my courses but may not use in my research, and this is true for other
faculty, yet citation metrics won't reflect that kind of use. The authors refer
to <em>altmetrics</em>, which was invented to help capture additional non-citing uses
of scholarly products, but altmetrics is still in its infancy and is largely
dependent on data sources and scholarly behavior that are problematic
themselves. Third, there are various issues with the metrics themselves. The
<em>Impact Factor</em> is based on a calculation that is outdated and not a very
appropriate statistical measure. The other calculations were created to address
that but may have other problems. And four, the use of the metrics, regardless
of which one, tends to drive publishing behavior---such that journal titles
with higher metrics tend to attract more submissions and more attention, thus
driving more citations to them. Thus, citation based metrics are comparable to
a kind of capitalist economic system where, as the sociologist of science
Robert Merton noted, <a href="http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthew1.pdf">the richer get richer (in citations) and the poor get
poorer</a>. The issue then is that prestige, defined in this way,
does not necessarily indicate quality---just use.</p>
<p>The authors also discuss some issues with <em>Gold Open Access</em> and the idea that
Gold OA may compound the cost problem. This is where authors pay a publication
fee, or an article processing charge (APC), once a manuscript has been
submitted and accepted by a journal (there are other types of Gold OA cost
models). We can do a quick off the cuff and rough calculation to see why this
might compound the problem. As an example, <em>PLOS ONE</em> is one of the largest
gold OA journals and charges an <a href="https://www.plos.org/publication-fees">APC of $1,695 USD</a> (that's $100 more
than it cost about a year ago). In 2018, 32 papers were published in PLOS ONE
that included at least one author from the University of Kentucky, totaling
$51,040 in APCs for the 50 total institutions that were associated with these
papers. Thus, this amounts to about $1020 per institution, paid for by the
authors and not libraries. For UK authors, this also amounts to over $32,640
spent on APCs (32 * $1020). This is about $27K more than the average price of
the most expensive category, Chemistry, as reported in Table 1 of the reading.
I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>In a follow-up video, I'll demonstrate some tools used to examine the discussed
metrics.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="licensing-basics"><a class="header" href="#licensing-basics">Licensing Basics</a></h1>
<p>This week we start two week's of discussion on licensing. Licensing is at the
top of the list of most important aspects of electronic resource management. We
start our coverage now because it was necessary to learn about the technical
and the economic aspects of ERM work as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>First, we should not that there is a hierarchical difference between <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/">copyright
law</a> and contract law. In short, although copyright is a kind of
<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/">temporary <em>right</em></a> (ante public domain status), unlike other
types of rights (e.g., legal or civil rights), it is a <em>right</em> that can be
transferred or sold by way of a contract. Contract law, thus, supersedes
copyright law.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.esports.law/blog/licensing-agreements-components-and-concerns">licensing agreements</a> offer copyright or
intellectual property owners a contractual framework. This framework functions
as a contractual agreement among two or more parties, and it enables the
parties involved to participate, within some range of time (all contracts must
have starting and ending dates), in an owner's intellectual property under
certain conditions. Librarians enter into licensing agreements of all kinds.
The types of things that are licensed include bibliographic databases, ILS/ERM
software, and of course, e-content. Unfortunately, regarding the latter,
entering a licensing agreement for e-content means that libraries do not own
that content but only have access for a period of time, as defined in the
contract. This is unlike print works, which fall under the first-sale doctrine.
That is, once a library ones, for example, a physical book, it owns it for as
long as they want to or can own it. Basically, the existence of a licensing
agreement between a library and an intellectual property owner entails lack of
ownership of the <em>item</em> (think of item as defined by the <em>Functional

<p>The readings are pretty straightforward, but let's preview some basics, which
are nicely outlined in Weir (2016) (not in the reading but referenced below):</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two general types of licensing agreements:
<ul>
<li><strong>End user agreements</strong> are generally the kind that people accept when
they use some kind of software or some service.</li>
<li><strong>Site agreements</strong> are the kinds of agreements librarians get involved
in when they negotiate for things like databases. Here, <em>site</em> refers to
the organizational entity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are several important parts of a standard license. They include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Introductions</strong>: this includes information about the licensee and the
licensor, date information, some information about payments and the
schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong>: this section defines the major terms of the contract.
Weir includes, as examples, the licensee, the licensor, authorized user,
user population, and whether the contract entails a single or multi-user
site.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong>: This covers topics such as IP authentication and proxy
access.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable use</strong>: Included here are issues related to downloading,
storage, print rights, interlibrary loan (ILL), and preservation.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited use</strong>: What cannot people do: download restrictions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: What the licensee's (the library) responsibilities.
Be careful about accepting responsibility for actions that the library
would have a difficult time monitoring. Then also, what are the
licensor's responsibilities. This might include topics such as 24 hour
access.</li>
<li><strong>Term and terminations</strong>: Details about the terms of the contract and
how the contract may be terminated. Be aware that many libraries are
attached to either municipal, county, or state governments and must
adhere to relevant laws.</li>
<li>Various provisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, the California Digital Library, via the University of
California, provides a <a href="https://cdlib.org/resources/vendors/license-agreement-checklist/">checklist</a> and a copy of their standard
license agreement.</p>
<p>The checklist covers four main sections and is well worth a read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content and Access</li>
<li>Licensing</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Management</li>
</ul>
<p>We have three additional readings this week. One of the readings covers SERU: A
Shared Electronic Resource Understanding, by NISO. We also have a short article
by Regan that provides some guidelines on becoming competent on licensing.</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/8593/RP-7-2012_SERU.pdf">SERU</a>, <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/seru">Shared Electronic Resource Understanding</a>, is a NISO
collaborative document that helped standardize some aspects of the licensing
process and can be used as &quot;an alternative to a license agreement&quot; if a
provider and a library agrees to use it. Like the standard licensing structure
that Weir (2016) outlines, SERU includes parts that describe use, inappropriate
use, access, and more but also posits other stipulations, such as
confidentiality and privacy.</p>
<p>The other reading is the <a href="https://www.nasig.org/Core-Competencies">NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources
Librarians</a>. We have already visited this, and although it doesn't
specifically cover licensing, I added it to this week's reading list for a
couple of reasons. First, it's a reminder that when we talk about electronic
resource management, we talk about a comprehensive list of responsibilities,
skills, technologies, and more, and I need to keep this on our radar. Second,
because the Regan reading specifically mentions these competencies, and I
thought it would good to reintroduce them here.</p>
<p>This week, after reading the material, I want you to focus on the Regan article
and some of the questions raised there. Regan raises important questions about
the licensing process, about effective communication, and about advocacy. I
want you to comment on these issues, and I want you to answer some questions
that Regan raises. You can do that by searching the web and library websites.
In fact, at the beginning of the semester I asked you to subscribe to the
SERIALST email list. It's now time to draw upon that and any discussions you've
seen in those lists that are related. You can usually search the archives of
those lists, especially since traffic has been a bit light recently. Regan
mentions some other sources, such as <a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/">LIBLICENSE</a> and
<a href="https://www.copyrightlaws.com/">copyrightlaws.com</a>. Any of these are fair game for our discussions,
but the latter is a commercial entity that provides material and tutorials for
a kind of tuition. It might be useful to know about it, but explore only if you
want. However, LIBLICENSE provides model licenses as well as links to
<a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/licensing-information/model-license/">additional model licences</a>, including the above mentioned
California Digital Library Standard License Agreement. The LIBLICENSE model
license includes even more details, such as types of authorized uses, and
details that include provisions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>course reserves</li>
<li>course packs</li>
<li>electronic links</li>
<li>scholarly sharing</li>
<li>scholarly citation</li>
<li>text and data mining</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we are watching a long video again and also have a solid number of
readings, I will keep this lecture short.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Abbie Brown, first. In her talk, note that she highlights the
middle ground on:</p>
<ul>
<li>principled negotiation</li>
<li>assertive communicators</li>
</ul>
<p>She also discusses, based on her experience, some stereotypes that get in the
way of negotiating. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Librarian stereotypes: Years ago, I was at a dinner with a friend of mine and
their family when my friend mentioned me going to library school. The father
of my friend then said, &quot;isn't that women's work?&quot; So the existence of this
stereotype is true, and if applicable to you, I hope you do not have to deal
with it. My advice is to stick with Abbie Brown's suggestion to focus on
principled negotiation and assertive communication. And if you're judged
based on other stereotypes, please don't tolerate it.</li>
<li>Library stereotypes: libraries are major players in the economy and have
important economic buying power. Know that you come from a position of power.</li>
<li>Vendors stereotypes: these are just as incorrect. As Brown notes, the people
who work for vendors often have Master's degrees from library science
programs. In fact, I went to library school with people who now work for
vendors, and students in this class have and do work for vendors. These
people are certainly aware of the complexities surrounding libraries and
librarians and the values that librarians uphold. So you often will have a
lot of mutual understanding from the start and should not necessarily have to
assume any baseline antagonism.</li>
<li>In the end, try work against any and all of these stereotypes. I think that
if you do this, then it will reduce a lot of anxiety that we might carry with
us when we go to the negotiating table.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like that also that Abbie Brown stresses the importance of building and
maintaining relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus from the beginning on building and maintaining a good relationship with your vendor. There are benefits to this, as Abbie Brown lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brown's practical suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>talk through things, with colleagues and vendors</li>
<li>write well and succinctly, and put in writing (and be careful what you put in
writing)</li>
<li>I know that some of you have already had hesitations about the licensing
agreements we've discussed already. Brown covers this in some detail and in
real world ways and discusses how, e.g., SERU, is not always used but is
still helpful to have out there as a point of reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to Brown's talk, we also read a few articles. The Smith and
Hartnett article provides a nice real world example of the negotiating process
that includes a work flow around licensing (again, the workflow!). Remember,
document everything and revisit your documentation. That's how formalized
checklists come into being and why they're useful. Having a workflow in place
around licensing will help make your work more efficient and help ensure that
all bases are covered.</p>
<p>The Dygert and Barrett article covers the specifics of licensing---what to look
for, what shouldn't be given away, how to negotiate principally, and more.
Likewise, the Dunie article gets into the specifics of the negotiation process
and includes definitions of terms, business models, and strategies.</p>
<p>This week will not necessarily prepare us to become negotiators. The main point
I want to make this week is this: if you find yourself in a position where one
of your job responsibilities is to negotiate with vendors for e-resources (or
for anything else), then come back to these sources of information and spend
additional time studying them and taking notes on them. Sources like these, and
others like them in the literature, will prepare you if you study them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="acquisitions-and-collections-development"><a class="header" href="#acquisitions-and-collections-development">Acquisitions and Collections Development</a></h1>
<p>Class, this week we discuss aspects of collection development and acquisitions,
which is a complex problem for electronic resources. To rehash, in the
print-only days, acquiring resources was a <em>more-than-it-is-now</em> linear
process. Librarians became aware of an item, sought reviews of the item,
possibly collected the item, described it, and then shelved it. And maybe,
depending on the type of the library, weeded it from the collection at some
point in the years to come during their regular course of collection
assessment.</p>
<p>There are additional vectors to be aware of with electronic resources. First,
libraries may or may not necessarily own digital works, but different
subscription services require different kinds of contracts, as we have learned.
Second, electronic resources (ebooks, journal articles, databases, etc.)
require different handling and disseminating processes due to technological and
licensing barriers. Martin et al. (2009) truly nail the issue in their article
where they write that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as we would like to think our primary concerns about collecting are
based on content, not format, e-resources have certainly challenged many
long-established notions of how we buy, collect, preserve, and provide access
to information (p. 217).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although a world where the format dictates so much makes an intriguing world,
it can be problematic and worrisome. We think that content should be king, but
we must ask, how does format either prevent or facilitate access? If you catch
the implicit gotcha there, you can see that we're building a thread between
acquisitions, collections development, and usability, which we'll learn more
about latter in the semester.</p>
<p>One thing about this week: in a collection development course, you would
unquestionably focus on content and on the work that is involved creating a
collection development policy (which I hope you do or spearhead if your library
does not have one). I'll briefly discuss this soon. Those things are relevant
to the acquisition and collection of e-resources. However, in a major way, one
of the things you should take away from this week's reading is how much the
management of electronic resources have impacted librarian work flows and how
that has shaped, or reshaped, library organizational hierarchy. I'll provide an
organizational chart for you to discuss, and we'll use it to discuss how
electronic resources have shaped the organizational structure of the library.</p>
<p>The Lamothe (2015) article is good in a different way. Lamothe finds that if
electronic e-reference sources are collected and perpetually updated, then they
get continually used. If it's a static e-resource (compare, e.g., to a resource
pushed out in PDF, although it could be in HTML), then usage declines. I hope
additional studies pursue this line of questioning because it raises questions
about the expectations that our patrons have about our content; perhaps
something about how <em>fresh</em> they expect that content should be, where such an
expectation may have existed in different shape in prior years. It also
suggests that a resource like Wikipedia has an advantage, since much of
Wikipedia is regularly updated, or the site in general appears broadly so since
many parts of it are continually updated.</p>
<p>The Open Educational Resources (OER) issue is a hot topic these days. Textbook
prices, as the article by England et al. (2017) notes, have skyrocketed in
recent decades. Some textbooks cost hundreds of dollars, and the problem
impacts both school and academic libraries. UK Libraries has a helpful page
about Open Educational Resources. I'll provide a link here in the transcript
and in the discussion prompt, and that page links to OER content for both types
of libraries, including <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/">oercommons.org</a>. Explore this information, and
discuss whether libraries ought to collect and acquire these resources  or
(e.g., by adding records to them in their online public access catalogs or
discovery systems), or should they not be involved at all? This seems like a
<em>duh</em> kind of question, but libraries, public or academic, have not
traditionally collected textbooks. Does this change the game for them as
educational institutions?</p>
<p>A quick note about the organizational charts. The chart that I created was
based on my readings of librarian departmental reports written during the late
1950s and early 1960s by librarians at UK. These reports are held at the
University of Kentucky's <a href="http://libraries.uky.edu/SC">Special Collections Research Center</a>, which
is fortunately in the building next to mine on campus. Organizational charts
have been around since the 1800s, but I am not sure when libraries started to
create and use them, and I didn't see one in my research on the history of UK
Libraries for this time period. Thus, I inferred the organizational structure
based on the detailed reports written by the various department heads in the
library at the time. When you compare my chart based on the past to the current
one provided by UK Libraries, I think you will be intrigued by how much more
complicated the current chart is today.</p>
<p>This complexity is very interesting. The growth in electronic resources,
associated technologies, and markets do not explain all of it: knowledge has
become more specialized, and library organizational structure will reflect
that; the student population has grown considerably since then, in size and
heterogeneity, and library structure will reflect that; and the theory and
praxis of library management has evolved throughout the decades, and library
structure will reflect that. Other issues are at play, and it is certainly true
that they are all interconnected, but I do think that technology and
e-resources accounts for a large portion of what we see here, and I'm looking
forward to reading what you have to say about this.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd be guilty of a serious wrongdoing if I did not discuss the
importance of having a collection development policy (CDP) and using that
policy to guide the collection, acquisition, and assessment of electronic
resources. I don't mean to overlap any discussions you may have had about this
if you've had a collection management course, I only want to emphasize the
importance of a CDP for e-resources. Unfortunately, not all libraries, even at
major institutions, create or use a CDP, and if you end up working at one, then
I'd highly encourage you to convince your colleagues of its importance. A CDP
should define a collection, and then include most if not all the following
topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>mission, vision, and values statement</li>
<li>purpose of CDP statement (scope may be included here)</li>
<li>selection criteria: this could be general but it could also include
subsections that focus on specific populations, genres, resource types, and
more</li>
<li>assessment and maintenance criteria</li>
<li>challenged materials criteria (esp important at public, K-12 libraries)</li>
<li>weeding and/or replacement criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Included in this transcript are links to two CDP policies, one from the
<a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/collections/policies/electronic-resources">University of Maryland</a> and one from the <a href="https://www.lexpublib.org/collection-development-policy">Lexington Public
Library</a>. The Maryland CDP is not their main one but is a sub-CDP
that focuses on electronic resources. The LPL policy is the main one for them,
and although it does not include a long discussion of electronic resources,
they are mentioned in the policy. Neither approach is wrong but are catered to
the specific libraries and their purposes, communities, and vision statements.
This week, I would like you to search on the web for more and to read through
ones you find for how they discuss electronic resources.</p>

<p>Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018) write that &quot;user experience determines the
quality of an interaction being used by an actor in order to achieve a specific
outcome.&quot; Parush (2017) highlights relevant terms like <em>human-computer
interaction (HCI)</em> and <em>usability</em>. Let's say then that HCI encompasses the
entire domain of interaction between people and computers and how that
interaction is designed, whereas <em>user experience (UX)</em> focuses on the quality
of that interaction or an interaction with something (like a product). These
are not precise definitions, and some might use the terms <em>UX</em> and <em>HCI</em>
interchangeably. As ERM librarians, though, it is our job to focus on the
quality of the patron's experience with our electronic services, and this
entails understanding both the systems and technologies involved and the users
interacting with these systems and technologies.</p>
<p>Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018) outline the parameters that are involved with UX.
Let me modify their example and frame it within the context of an ERM
experience for a patron:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actor</strong>: a user of the web resource, like a library website</li>
<li><strong>Object</strong>: the web resource, or some part of it</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: the setting. What's happening? What's the motivation for use?
What's the background knowledge? What's the action?</li>
<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: the tools made available by the object as well as the
look and feel. More specifically, Parush (2017) states that &quot;the user
interface mediates between the user and computer&quot; and it includes three basic
components:
<ul>
<li><em>controls</em>: the tools used to control and interact with the system:
buttons, menus, voice commands, keyboards, etc</li>
<li><em>displays</em>: the information presented to the user or the hardware used to
present the information: screens, speakers, etc.</li>
<li><em>interactions and dialogues</em>: the exchange between the system and the
user including the use of the controls and responding to feedback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interaction</strong>: what the actor is doing with the UI</li>
<li><strong>(Intended/Expected/Prior) User experience</strong>: the intended or expected use
of the object. The user's expectations based on prior use.</li>
<li><strong>(Actual) User experience</strong>: the actions that took place; the actions that
had to be modified based on unintended results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters would be helpful for devising a UX study that involves
observing patrons interacting with a system and then interviewing them to
complete the details. Note that the same kind of systematic thinking can be
applied to evaluate other user experiences, like those between a librarian and
an electronic resource management system. Often the focus is on patron user
experience, but it's just as important to evaluate UX for librarians and to
consider UX when selecting an ERM system or an ILS system.</p>
<p>In any case, these parameters help us step through and highlight the
complicated process of interacting with a computer, generally, or a library
resource, more specifically. As with many other topics we've discussed this
semester, we can also incorporate these parameters into a workflow for
evaluating UX. But, it is because of the complexities involved and a focus on
the systems that Pennington (2015) argues for a more UX centered approach to
library website design. To emphasize their case, think about your own state of
knowledge of ERM before you started to take this course. For example, a number
of you have explored in depth how link resolvers function, and your experience
using them as patrons and your understanding of their technical aspects as
librarians have provided you with a set of skills and experiences that make you
more likely to identify the cause of a malfunction if you find one. But with
the ability to suss out an issue, it becomes easier to solve, and the
experience itself involves less anxiety. Most users and patrons of these
systems will not have any technical knowledge of these systems, and when they
break for them, their frustration with the <strong>experience</strong> might lead to
unfortunate outcomes. For example, they may not retrieve the information they
need; they may not reach out to a librarian; they might stop using the
library's resources in preference for something of inferior quality; and so
forth. We need to not forget that this happens, and if possible, to likewise
design for such failures of a system (because they will fail). How might we,
for instance, design an action to occur when a link resolver or a proxy server
fails to identify and retrieve a work?</p>
<p>Here's the crux. As you gain more skill and expertise with these systems, you
will eventually lose the ability to see these systems as a novice user, and
that distance will only grow over time. It is therefore, as Pennington (2015)
argues, important to gather data from users. User experience research nurtures
a user centered mindset.</p>
<p>The second article by Pennington, Chapman, Fry, Deschenes, and McDonald (2016)
is a contribution from four librarians with theoretical and practical
suggestions for UX research. Both Pennington and Chapman note the best way to
measure UX or detect UX issues is to conduct research with users (recall our
conversations on proactive troubleshooting), but this isn't always possible due
to financial, time, or other constraints. However, there is a wealth of
research on UX and in the absence of the ability to conduct research, locating
prior research and applying that research to your setting is paramount. Drawing
from the literature, Chapman describes several important UX principles that
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>chunking</li>
<li>highlighting and prominence</li>
<li>KISS</li>
<li>choice simplification</li>
<li>choice reduction</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to user studies and prior research, libraries possess a wealth of
data to explore and this data could provide a lot of insight. The same caveat
applies that Chapman described: if only you have time to analyze the data. But
Fry points out that you can access library data about location of user, device
type, resource use, and more. (There are some privacy issues involved with
this, and we'll talk about them at the end of the semester.) Furthermore,
here's where the Browning (2015) article is helpful. Whereas Fry describes what
we can learn from data about usage, Browning describes what we can learn from
data about breakage. Both kinds of data can offer us a substantial
understanding about user experience.</p>
<p>If you can conduct a user study, then Deschenes offers helpful tips on
recruiting users. Remember that the users that you recruit should be actual
users of the systems. If you are interested in why some segments of the
population do not use the library's resources, then that would be a different
kind of study.</p>
<p>I agree with McDonald that despite having around 30 or so years of experience
with web-based electronic resources, more with other types of electronic
resources that existed prior to the web and that were based on the then
internet, on optical disks, etc., we are still in the throes of disruption.
There's a lot yet to learn about design for the web, just like there's a lot of
left to learn about how to design a home or office, and nothing will be settled
for a while. Although I doubt if there will be any single dominate user
experience or user interface, since there are many cultures and backgrounds and
experiences, I'm fairly sure the low-hanging fruit problems will work out
eventually. Remember though that 95% of the cause of all of this is due to
copyright issues, which necessitate the entire electronic resource ecosystem
and the complications that are introduced by having to work with vendors who
work with different, but overlapping, publishers, etc. If something were to
change about copyright, then it's a whole new ballgame.</p>
<p>On a final note, you might be wondering how <em>information seeking</em> is related to
<em>HCI</em> and to <em>UX</em>. Anytime we interact with a computer (broadly speaking) in
order to seek information, then we have an overlap. But there are areas of
non-overlap, too. We don't always use computers to look for information, and we
don't always look for information on computers. <em>UX</em> is like this, too. <em>UX</em> is
not always about computers but can be about user experience generally. I bring
this up because if you do become involved with <em>UX</em> work at a library (or
elsewhere), then I'd encourage you to refer also to the information seeking and
related literature when it's appropriate to do so. Remember, it's all
interconnected.</p>

<p>We've discussed problems this semester with defining terms, and we have learned
that a lot of effort has been expended into standardizing them. We have also
seen that the topics that we've covered---technologies, standards, access,
usability, workflow, markets, licensing---are linked in some way. All this
complexity makes the measurement of <em>usage</em> that much more complicated. The
problem is that when electronic resources (or basically all activity on the web
and internet) are accessed, a computer server somewhere keeps a log of that
interaction. Having logs available makes it seem that we can have accurate data
about usage, but it's not a guarantee, and the insight we may be able to glean
is always difficult to acquire no matter how much data is available to us.</p>
<p>Example web server access log entry (I've obfuscated the IP address and the
website domain):</p>
<pre><code>99.999.99.99 - - [21/Oct/2021:10:54:35 -0400] &quot;GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1&quot; 404 517 &quot;https://WEBSITE.edu/&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/93.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Access log type data can be good data to explore, but we have to be mindful
that all data has limitations, and that there are different ways to define what
usage means. For example, the log snippet above indicates that I visited that
link at that server, but does that mean that I really <strong>used</strong> that website
even though I accessed it? Even if we can claim that I did, what kind of use
was it? Can we tell? (We can actually learn quite a lot from web server access
logs.)</p>
<p>This week we learn about the efforts that have gone into standardizing usage
metrics and usage reports via Project Counter. Also, we see a few examples of
how usage data can help inform collection development and benefit the library
in other ways. This is an important area of electronic resource librarianship,
but it's also an area that may overlap with other parts of librarianship, such
as systems librarianship or collection development. Here we might see job
titles like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=library+systems+administrator">library systems administrator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="project-counter"><a class="header" href="#project-counter">Project Counter</a></h2>
<p>Project Counter is a Code of Practice that seeks to help provide more
informative and consistent reporting of electronic resource usage. From
<a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/introduction-to-counter-code-of-practice-release-5/">Project Counter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its inception in 2002, COUNTER has been focused on providing a code of
practice that helps ensure librarians have access to consistent, comparable,
and credible usage reporting for their online scholarly information. COUNTER
serves librarians, content providers, and others by facilitating the
recording and exchange of online usage statistics. The COUNTER Code of
Practice provides guidance on data elements to be measured and definitions of
these data elements, as well as guidelines for output report content and
formatting and requirements for data processing and auditing. To have their
usage statistics and reports designated COUNTER compliant, content providers
MUST provide usage statistics that conform to the current Code of Practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, these reports were designed to help solve a problem that will likely
never completely be solved, but it's still an important and useful effort. The
main goal of Counter is to provide usage reports, and the reports, for version
5 of Counter, cover four major areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Titles</li>
<li>Items</li>
</ul>
<p>And you can see which reports these four replace in <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/2448-2/">a table in Appendix B of
the Code of Practice</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/foreword/">Counter 5</a> was designed to include better reporting consistency,
better clarity of metrics that measure usage activity, better views of the
data, and more. In order to clarify the purpose of Counter, let's review the
introduction to the <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/introduction-to-counter-code-of-practice-release-5/">Code of Practice</a>, which articulates the
purpose, scope, application, and more of Counter.</p>
<p>[ Note: Review the Introduction to the Code of Practice ]</p>
<h2 id="readings"><a class="header" href="#readings">Readings</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2017.1391153">Pesch (2017)</a> provides a helpful introduction to the history of
Project Counter and the migration from Counter version 4 to version 5. Table 1
in Pesch describes the four major reports. Most of the reports are
self-explanatory. Database, Title, and Item reports cover what they describe,
but Platform reports might be less obvious. These reports include usage metrics
at the broadest level and of things like EBSCOhost databases, ProQuest
databases, SAGE resources, Web of Science databases, and so on. These reports
come into play when users/patrons search in the overall platform but not in any
single database provided by the platform. For example, UK Libraries subscribes
to the ProQuest Databases and for us, that includes <a href="https://www.proquest.com/databases/advanced?accountid=11836">35 primary
databases</a>. Users can search many at the same time or search any single
one. The same holds for platforms like EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and others.
This is the platform level.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2016.1165783">Scott (2016)</a> article provides a nice use case for how Counter
reports can inform collection development. We've talked a bit about the <em>Big
Deal</em> packages that more libraries are trying to move away from because such
deals often include access to titles that are not used or not relevant to a
library community. Here Scott shows that it might be possible to avoid
subscribing to some services using this data, but it's also important to
closely read through and understand the problems associated with interlibrary
loan, the metrics, and other limitations described in the Conclusion section of
this article.</p>
<p>We move away from Project Counter with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5860/crl12-406">Stone and Ramsden
(2013)</a> article. I wanted to introduce this article because it
highlights how metrics can be used to assess the value of a library, which is
often underestimated by administration but constantly required in order to
garner the resources needed to improve or sustain a library's resources. Here
Stone and Ramsden investigate the correlation (not causation) between library
usage and student retention. Increasing the latter is the Holy Grail of college
and universities. If this were a public library report, it might be interesting
to see how well electronic library usage correlates to continued usage and how
such a correlation might result in various outcomes defined by the library. One
nice thing about the Stone and Ramsden article is that it does not depend on
quantitative metrics alone but supports its findings through qualitative
research. There's only so much a usage metric can say.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like you to be aware of the <a href="https://code4lib.org/"><em>code{4}lib</em> journal</a>
and this article by <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10589">Zou</a> is pretty cool. Although this article overlaps
with some security issues, a topic that we'll cover in our last week of the
semester, the article also provides a way of thinking outside the box about the
metrics that you'll have access to as an electronic resource librarian. Here,
Zou describes a process of taking EZproxy logs (compare the example entry with
the web server entry I included above) and turning them into something useful
and dynamic by incorporating some additional technologies. Recall that
<a href="https://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html">EZproxy</a> is software that authenticates users and provides access
given that authentication. We use EZproxy at UK whenever we access a paywalled
journal article. That is, you've noticed the <strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong> string in any
URL for a journal that you've accessed via UK Libraries' installation of
EZproxy, and the URL <code>https://login.ezproxy.uky.edu/login</code> is the log in URL.
Zou specifically references <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210716020704/https://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/post/analyzing-ezproxy-logs/">the standard way</a> of analyzing these logs
(take a look at the page at that link), which can be insightful and helpful,
but Zou's method makes the analysis of these logs more visual and real-time.
The main weakness with Zou's method is that it seems to me to be highly
dependent on Zou doing the work. If Zou leaves their library, then this
customized analysis might not last. Still, it's good to know that if you have
an interest in developing skills with systems administration, with various
other technologies, and with some basic scripting language, this kind of thing,
and more, is possible.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="privacy-and-security"><a class="header" href="#privacy-and-security">Privacy and Security</a></h1>
<p>Breeding starts off with <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/5973/7606">Chapter 1</a> from <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/issue/view/549">this week's
reading</a> of <a href="https://journals.ala.org/">Library Technology Reports</a> with the following
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Libraries have a long tradition of taking extraordinary measures to ensure the privacy of those who use their facilities and access their materials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is mostly true but not entirely so. When I was an undergraduate, I
remember going to the library to look for books on a sensitive topic. I saw a
book on the shelves that looked relevant, and when I pulled it off the shelf
and opened it, I noticed that a friend of mine had checked the book out before
me because their name was written on the due date card in their handwriting.
Even though I had grown up with these due date cards in library books, it had
never occurred to me before then how these cards could pose a problem with
privacy. At the time, I decided not to check out that book because of that
issue.</p>
<p>We might be comforted in thinking that the kind of information that was
supposedly revealed to me in the book that my friend had checked out, and that
I had opened, is the kind of information that would not scale up easily. It was
a serendipitous event that involved me looking for a book on the same topic and
then just happening to pick the one book that my friend had used. It's not
likely, then, that this might pose a big problem at scale.</p>
<p>However, let's think of that information in that due date card as metadata, and
then ask, how could we use it? The sociologist Kieren Healy did that kind of
thing with membership lists from colonial times. He showed that using limited
data like the one I found in that book, some important things could be
discovered. For example, <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/">Healy</a> imagined that if the British had
access to simple social network analysis tools back in 1772, they could have
identified that Paul Revere was a patriot and then have used that information
to prevent or interfere with the American Revolution. I encourage you to read
his blog entry and his <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/11/following-up-on-paul-revere/">follow-up reflection</a> because it is a neat
<em>what-if</em> hypothetical case study.</p>
<p>Most libraries in North America have replaced due date slips with bar codes,
and while this has removed the problem above, the overall migration from
paper-based workflows to electronic ones have raised other problems. Not long
after the Patriot Act was passed after 9/11, FBI agents ordered a Connecticut
librarian to <a href="https://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-librarians-stand-up-to-patriot-act-again-20160927-story.html">&quot;identify patrons who had used library computers online at a
specific time one year earlier&quot;</a>. Per the law, the librarians
involved were placed under a gag order, which prevented them from speaking out.
This led to a lawsuit against the then US Attorney General. Eventually the
librarians were released from their gag order and allowed to discuss the event.</p>
<p>There are occasionally big, dramatic cases like the one described above, but
privacy and security issues are often much more mundane but still quite
important. Since many users of libraries of all types visit library homepages,
then encrypting all the web/internet traffic is important. A year and a half
ago, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/browsers-to-block-access-to-https-sites-using-tls-1-0-and-1-1-starting-this-month/">major web browsers announced</a> that they would no longer
support Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol versions 1.1 or earlier, and
that any site that had not yet migrated to TLS version 1.2 or above will not be
accessible. TLS is used to encrypt web traffic. This news came out in early
March 2020, and the browsers postponed blocking these sites because of the
pandemic. But the migration went into affect a few months later, and as you can
see in the screenshot below, for a while I had to enable an insecure connection
to libraries.uky.edu in Firefox if I wanted to visit it. When I enabled it,
then my activity on libraries.uky.edu was potentially visible to others under
certain conditions. Note, however, that once I sign into my library account,
I'm transferred to Primo's cloud service, and then to UK's OAuth page to log
in. These parts of the encryption chain are fairly strong. So it's only
activity specifically on libraries.uky.edu that was not good at the time.</p>
<p><img src="uklibrariesTLSversion.png" alt="UK Libraries TLS Version Block in Firefox" /></p>
<p>In Chapter 1 of this week's reading, Breeding does a nice job introducing a
variety of technologies and policies that are related to security and privacy.
There are important technological things to consider, like web traffic
encryption. There are also important policy considerations, too, like how third
party vendors implement privacy and security mechanisms (like the Primo example
above). Note that the <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-7-2012-seru">SERU</a> recommended practice has a section
dedicated to Confidentiality and Privacy. In case you work at a library that
does not use SERU, this is how SERU can be useful to you. It can inform us of
the kinds of provisions that a library ought to have in a license if the
default provisions a vendor proposes do not include the necessary components.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Breeding reports on the state of privacy and security protections
among a selection of ERM vendors. I should note that although this article is
only four years old, this area moves fast and it's likely that the problems
that Breeding identifies with some implementations have been fixed in recent
years. As I noted, since browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari have
grown stricter about enforcing encryption, web services have complied by
adhering to better security standards. Chapter 3 covers the same issue from the
library's perspectives. Here is where improvements are much less likely to be
seen. For example, a number of library sites use Google Analytics to track site
usage and other metrics, but this means that our actions, albeit somewhat
anonymized, on these library sites are being collected and stored by Google (or
some other analytic service). Also, many websites, library websites included,
use fonts that are hosted on other servers, but doing so means that these can
be tracked, too (see my the access log entry above as a basic example). There's
a trade-off, though. If we want to learn more about how users interact with the
site in order to improve usability and accessibility, then we have to have some
of this data. Here's where a privacy policy might come into play.</p>
<p>Thus, I point to a <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15340">controversial article</a> that was published on
the <em>code4lib</em> journal last year. I'd highly encourage you to peruse the
article as well as <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15340#comment-2744977">the comments at the bottom of the page</a>:</p>
