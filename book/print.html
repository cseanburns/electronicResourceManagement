<p>This semester we're learning about electronic resources
and about how to manage them.
Let's begin by outlining the kinds of things
that are electronic resources.
<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/940697515">Karin Wikoff</a> (2011) outlines the major categories,
and these include:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ebook technology is rather complicated and
differentiated depending on the copyright status,
the file type (PDF, ePUB, TXT, etc.), and
the purpose or genre
(textbook, fiction or non-fiction, etc.).
In some cases, ebooks are software applications and
not just plain or marked up text.
They also vary by platform or
the application used to interact with the text,
each of which may offer different types of functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linking technologies allow users
to begin in one search system,
like a discovery service,
which extends that query to other systems
without requiring the user to
initiate searches in those other systems.
For example,
a user begins a search in a library's discovery system,
like UK Library's <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY%3AUKY&amp;lang=en">InfoKat</a>
(powered by Primo (<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/11856/">Breeding, 2006</a>)).
InfoKat identifies multiple articles there
related to the query,
even though those articles are all located in other
full text systems, like EBSCOHost, ProQuest, or JSTOR.</p>
<h2 id="framing"><a class="header" href="#framing">Framing</a></h2>
<p>The print only era of libraries
was difficult enough for many reasons, but
managing print and using print resources
was comparably a more linear process.
Electronic resources have raised the stakes.
That might be expected:
civilizations have had 500 years
to develop and solve print technology,
yet we have had only about three plus decades of
experience with digital technology.
We are a long way off from stability, and
many of the challenges and frustrations
ahead of us are not simply technical but
also social and legal.</p>
<p>As you may surmise from the outline at the top of this page,
electronic resources are a major part of any library,
whether academic, public, school, or special.
The need to manage them with
efficient work flows requires
attending to many parts of a big system.
This will be much of what we will discuss and
learn about, especially because
there is a lot of complexity in these systems and
these systems have had a major impact on librarianship itself.</p>
<h2 id="our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship"><a class="header" href="#our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship">Our Readings: The nature of ERM librarianship</a></h2>
<p>Our readings this week provide
introductions to electronic resource librarianship
and help frame this course.</p>
<h3 id="a-specialist-and-a-generalist"><a class="header" href="#a-specialist-and-a-generalist">A Specialist and A Generalist</a></h3>
<p>The first article by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07317131.2017.1385286">Stachokas</a> (2018)
surveys the history of this specialist/generalist librarian role.
Stachokas (2018) finds that
the electronic resource librarian has their feet
planted in technical services and collection development,
that this requires a holistic understanding of the 
electronic resource work flow,
of its embeddedness in the scholarly and library ecosystem, and
that this division is leading to different areas of specialization:
those who focus on
&quot;licensing, acquisitions, and collection development&quot; (p. 15),
and those who focus on
&quot;metadata, discovery, management of 
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/kbart/kbart-frequently-asked-questions">knowledge bases</a>, and
addressing technical problems&quot; (p. 15).
This rings true to me.
In my own observations,
I've noticed that job announcements have increasingly stressed
one of the above areas and not both.</p>
<h3 id="the-technical-communicator-as-the-bridge"><a class="header" href="#the-technical-communicator-as-the-bridge">The Technical Communicator as the &quot;Bridge&quot;</a></h3>
<p>In the second article,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2016.1164555">Hulseberg</a> (2016) uses
the field of <a href="https://www.stc.org/about-stc/defining-technical-communication/">technical communication (TC)</a>
to interpret the field of electronic resource librarianship.
Hulseberg (2016) takes the view that an
electronic resource librarian is, among other things,
a technical communicator.
This is much different from being
someone who helps patrons with their technical problems.
Rather, this is someone who completes advanced work in
documenting and reporting technical processes.</p>
<p>Hulseberg (2016) highlights four important themes about ERM:
the interesting themes to me are
<em>Theme one: Metaphors of &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;translator&quot;</em>, and
<em>Theme Two: Collaborating in a web of relationships</em>.
When I was an undergraduate,
I imagined the job that I wanted
would be one connected people from different silos
to each other and helping them communicate.
It turns out that,
under Hulseberg's (2016) view,
electronic resource librarianship does this work,
which is pretty cool.
However, the other themes are just as important, and
in particular, <strong>Theme Four</strong>, about jurisdiction,
highlights one of the major disruptive acts on librarianship
in the last thirty or forty years.</p>
<p>As an example,
consider that most people,
researchers and scholars included,
use non-library provided resources to locate information.
Additionally, more works, scholarly and non-scholarly,
are freely and publicly available on the web,
e.g., as <a href="https://sparcopen.org/open-access/">open access (OA)</a>.
This might mean that the library
<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10355/37582">is becoming disintermediated</a>
as a result of people using non-library services,
like Google or Google Scholar,
to retrieve freely available works on the web,
instead of at the library.
As a result, what becomes of the core jurisdiction of the librarian?
And of the electronic resource librarian, in particular?
In concrete terms: a recent paper (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-03-2018-0047">Klitzing, 2009</a>)
reported that researchers state they use
Google Scholar 83% of the time and
EBSCOhost 29% of the time to find relevant material.
That raises strategic and technical questions about today's role
of the librarian and library in the scholarly communication system.</p>
<h3 id="to-license-or-not-to-license"><a class="header" href="#to-license-or-not-to-license">To License or Not To License</a></h3>
<p>The third article, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2016.02.002">Zhu</a> (2016),
places a different theoretical lens
on what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.
Zhu (2016) posits that the licensing aspect of
electronic resource management significantly influences
ER librarianship identity.
One reason why Zhu's (2016) findings are insightful is
due to the fact that we often license electronic resources
rather than buy them.</p>
<p>The crux centers around copyright law, which
provides librarians
with an important legal justification
for lending works:
the <a href="https://search.copyright.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=copyright&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=%22first+sale+doctrine%22">First Sale Doctrine</a>.
Copyright law provides copyright owners with the
right to distribute their work, but
the First Sale Doctrine holds that if you buy a copy of a book,
then you have a right to lend or sell your copy.
This doctrine is fundamental to librarianship but
also raises problems since most digital works
(ebooks, etc)
are licensed and not bought by libraries.
Thus the First Sale Doctrine does not apply
to such works.
That ALA has a guide on this issue
(<a href="https://libguides.ala.org/copyright/firstsale">ALA, 2022</a>).</p>
<p>Stachokas (2018), Hulseberg (2016), and Zhu (2016)
present the historical and environmental forces
that have shaped the work of electronic resource librarians and
their professional identities, and
each of these authors discuss important themes
that function as evidence of these identities.
In our discussions this week,
we should focus on these themes and
how to make sense of them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Electronic resource librarianship is a
fascinating area of librarianship.
Because digital technologies have woven their way
into all parts of the modern library ecosystem,
and because these digital technologies bring with them
a slew of technical, legal, and social challenges,
electronic resource librarians have had,
as these technologies have developed,
to maintain a holistic view of this ecosystem just
as they have had to specialize in key areas that
require maintaining that holistic, interconnected view.</p>
<p>The course takes that holistic view and
divides it into four parts for study.
In the first part,
we study the nature of the work itself:
what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.</p>
<p>In the second part, we learn about the technologies
that an electronic resource librarian uses and
the conditions that shape these technologies.
We will learn about integrated library systems (ILS) and
how these systems conform (or not) to standards, and
how they foster or obstruct 
interoperability and access.</p>
<p>In the third part, we focus on processes and their contexts.
We will study the electronic resource librarian's workflow,
the economics and the markets of electronic resources,
what is involved in licensing these resources and
negotiating with vendors.</p>
<p>At the end, we focus on patrons and end users;
that is, those we serve. 
Because electronic resources are digital,
when we use them, we leave behind traces of that usage.
This means we will study how that usage is measured and
what those measurements can validly say.
Because usage leaves traces of personal information,
we will examine topics related to the
security of these resources and the privacy of those
who use them.
Electronic resources likewise means having to use websites
and other e-resource interfaces, and
hence we will study how electronic resource librarians
are involved in user experience and usability studies.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-questions"><a class="header" href="#discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</a></h2>
<p>As we start to address all of this,
I want us to consider two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we manage all of this electronic stuff? Not only
does it include complicated technology and has an impact
on our patrons, but it involves all different sorts of
librarians.</li>
<li>What exactly is an electronic resource librarian? I like
this basic question because, due to perhaps
representations in the media (movies, TV shows, books)
and the interactions we've had with librarians in our
lifetimes, we all have pretty well-defined, whether
accurate, images of what reference or cataloging
librarians are. But what about an electronic resource
librarian? This is something different, right? And it's
not likely to be a position that's ever really captured
and presented publicly.</li>

<p>Class, in this section, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame the readings</li>
<li>discuss the readings, and</li>
<li>list some questions to guide our discussion for the week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal in this section is
to understand how the job of
electronic resource management (ERM)
has changed throughout the years and
to develop some ideas about where it is headed.</p>
<h3 id="framing-1"><a class="header" href="#framing-1">Framing</a></h3>
<p>This week we read two articles
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2014.03.013">Hartnett, 2014</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lcats.2009.11.001">Murdock, 2010</a>)
that analyze electronic resource librarian job advertisements.
Additionally, the reading list includes
the NASIG core competencies
for electronic resource librarianship.
I suggest that you review the list of core competencies
before you read the articles.</p>
<p>These articles are of interest since
they capture a description of electronic resource librarianship
in earlier years.
There are many social, political, and economic conditions that
have stayed about the same since these articles were published,
and these conditions help fixate the work of the ERM librarian,
but constant changes in technologies and types of electronic resources
have meant that electronic resource librarians are
constantly adapting to new work flows.
Our Murdoch (2010) reading makes this point.</p>
<p>Though the technology differs,
the descriptions and duties of ER jobs are still
on the mark in many ways.
I posted links to job announcements
in the discussion forum to demonstrate this.
Most of those job announcements
were emailed to the <a href="https://www.nasig.org/SERIALST">SERIALST</a>
email list (please subscribe to it) and
are not current job openings, but
they were current within the last few years.</p>
<p>To follow up on more current advertisements for ER librarians,
I did a Google search on August 15, 2022 using the following query:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;electronic resource librarian&quot; job
</code></pre>
<p>Results are consistent with past qualifications listed in the links
mentioned above and
with the <a href="01-the-erm-librarian.html">last section's</a> discussions
on the nature of ERM librarianship.
I will withhold linking to these advertisements since I don't expect
the links to persist as the positions get filled.
But several sources outline the following requested qualifications, and
I think the <strong>themes</strong> from the prior section come through
in this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide &quot;consistent and reliable access to the Library's electronic resources
and establishing workflows that maintain discovery and use of all Library
collections&quot;</li>
<li>analyze &quot;feasibility of technical platforms&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;resource licensing and contracting&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;copyright compliance&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;vendor negotiations&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Acts as a bridge across multiple Library units&quot;</li>
<li>enhance &quot;access and use&quot;</li>
<li>design a &quot;system of access&quot;</li>
<li>analyze &quot;staff and user issues with discovery of resources&quot;</li>
<li>coordinate &quot;system administration responsibilities for integrated library

limited to usage statistics, user experience statistics, collection analysis
and overlap&quot;</li>
<li>monitor &quot;listservs for Alma and Primo VE&quot;</li>

<li>develop and implement &quot;submissions to a shared University institutional
repository&quot;</li>
<li>works &quot;under the supervision of the Associate Director for Technical Services&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>To stay current about the position overall and
about the specific duties involved,
I encourage you to bookmark and
stay abreast of relevant journals in the area.
In addition to the two publication titles used in this
section's readings
and to the SERIALST list I have asked you to subscribe to,
I recommend that you bookmark relevant journals, like the
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/wacq20/current">Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship</a>,
<a href="https://www.charleston-hub.com/media/atg/">Against the Grain</a>, and
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/werm20/current">Journal of Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries</a></p>
<h3 id="our-readings"><a class="header" href="#our-readings">Our Readings</a></h3>
<p>Now let's start with Murdock's (2010) overview of the
electronic resource librarian's position
in the first decade of this century, and
proceed to Harnett's (2014) work that describes the
electronic resource librarian's duties around ten years ago.
NASIG's core competencies were also published around ten years ago
and have only received minor revisions since then.
We conclude by considering the current job advertisements
listed above and elsewhere.
With these,
our goal in this section is to get a sense of the
electronic resource librarian's job duties and
available technologies
from the earlier part of this century to now;
to understand where it was, how it has evolved,
and where it might be headed.
Overall, you will get a sense of just how much
this position has changed in the intervening years,
what I refer to as <strong>constant disruption</strong> in the next section.</p>
<p>One of the useful aspects of Murdock's (2010) article
is in section 4.3,
which lists a 'timeline of commercial ERM developments and standards.'
These technologies and standards
continue today,
and have, via hindsight,
strongly shaped how electronic resources currently work.
This timeline includes what's now referred to
as the A-Z list of serials,
which started in 2000,
OpenURL linking technology from 2001,
the combining of both integrated library systems (ILS)
and electronic resource management systems (ERMS) in 2004,
federated searching from 2005,
SUSHI usage statistics protocol from 2006,
and SERU from 2007.
We will explore each of these topics in future sections.</p>
<p>Murdock's (2010) analysis shows that some duties
started to wane in the early years.
Website maintenance and deployment (see Fig 13),
for example,
completely dropped off the radar.
This was likely due to the development of
content management systems,
i.e., turnkey website solutions,
that are still in use today.
For example, I remember <a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>
and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>,
both content management systems that
can work as library websites,
taking off around 2007 to 2009,
around the time that Murdock shows this area of activity declining.</p>
<p>One of Murdock's (2010) conclusions is that
employers sought &quot;to hire those who are able to perform
traditional librarian duties, such as reference and
instructional service, in addition to e-resource specific
tasks&quot; (p. 37).
Based on what we see in job advertisements today,
this seems to be much less the case as
electronic resource librarians have become more specialized,
as the position has divided into two areas
(cf., technical services aspect and collection development aspect),
and as electronic resources have grown and become more
dominant in the intervening years.
ER librarians still liaison with their communities but
in different ways (i.e., not as reference librarians).</p>
<p>A big change since 2012,
when Harnett's (2014) research ends,
is that more technology has moved to the cloud.
What this means is that we rely less on onsite servers,
where those servers might be managed by library IT (or other IT).
Switching from local IT infrastructure to
cloud based IT infrastructure
requires different types of technological skills
and suggests that conceptual knowledge
is paramount.
(This is my opinion, but it's based on years of
doing and teaching systems administration work.)
For example, it's more important to have a conceptual understanding
of how metadata works than to know how to use some
piece of software for managing metadata
(aside: however, conceptual and practical knowledge
cannot so easily be divorced from each other).
Metadata standards and schemes change far less often
than the software used to enter or administer metadata.</p>
<p>Cloud-based solutions have changed
the field in other ways.
Hosted software means
the software isn't purchased but leased,
and leasing involves outside vendors
who must have the technological skill sets
and resources to manage and provide the technology.
So we rely, in very important ways, and
are more dependent on other actors in the
publishing and e-resource provider ecosystem.
That involves a lot of trust, and
it involves more negotiations between
librarians and vendors, and
the ability to collaborate and develop good, ethical
relationships.
The kind of work that may increase,
as more software and data are hosted on the cloud,
might be the kind of work that requires strong communication
skills, strong negotiating skills, and
knowledge of how licensing works,
how copyright and contract law work, and
how electronic resource collections work and
inter-operate across platforms.
However, again, this can be complicated.
A couple of years ago there was an email
on the SERIALST listserv
by a librarian that asked whether librarians
have retained powers to negotiate and sign contracts.
The responses were mixed.
Some librarians had the jurisdiction but
many had lost it, per the email responses.
Even under this scenario, though,
technological understanding is necessary
in order to negotiate the best deal
for a library's stakeholders and
to acquire the best and
most seamless product needed by library users.</p>
<p>Even though IT continues to be outsourced,
this doesn't mean that we become lax
in our understanding of how the technology works;
just as we can't become lax in how librarianship
works even though librarians answer fewer reference questions
than they did in previous years
(i.e., you still need to know how to respond
systematically and thoroughly
to research and reference questions).
What I mean is that,
in order to communicate this topic well,
to negotiate well, and
to sign licenses that are beneficial to our communities,
it helps to understand and
be adept at the tech so that
we are not bamboozled in those negotiations.
Also, if something goes wrong,
e.g., with the link resolver technology,
we have to learn how to identify the problem;
that is, whether the technological issue
is the link resolver technology and not something else,
like the OPAC technology.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-1"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-1">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I want you to think about these
job advertisement studies in relation
to what you are learning about electronic resources
as well as in relation to the kinds of advertisements
you've seen since whenever you started paying attention to them,
like those outlined at the beginning of this section.
In essence, think about where you see yourself
in these advertisements and how they impact you.</p>
<p>Although it might be the case that most of you
haven't had a chance to learn electronic resource back ends,
that doesn't disqualify you from attempts
to start reflecting on this part of librarianship.
As library users of these technologies,
you have gathered enough abstract and practical knowledge
to know enough.</p>
<h3 id="questions-for-discussion"><a class="header" href="#questions-for-discussion">Questions for Discussion</a></h3>
<p>We'll soon move away from reflective questions and
get our hands dirty with specific technologies, licensing, etc.,
but for now let's reflect on the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you think you stand in comparison to ERM job ads and to <a href="https://www.nasig.org/Competencies-Eresources">NASIG Core
Competencies</a>?
<ul>
<li>Where are you strong?</li>
<li>Where would you like to improve?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What can you (and we, as a course community) do to help each of you get there?
<ul>
<li>What's your path?</li>
<li>What can you practice?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I think we might conclude at this point that there are many
different ways to frame the role of the
electronic resource librarian.
In <a href="01-the-erm-librarian.html">The ERM Librarian chapter</a>,
Stachokas (2018) showed how the
electronic resource librarian works across technical
services and collection development and
how this requires a holistic view as well as a specialized
understanding of the various processes involved.
Huleberg (2016) illustrated how framing
electronic resource librarianship as a technical
communicator yields important insights into the work
and profession.
Zhu (2016) used the licensing aspect of electronic resource
management work to show how central this activity
is to the field's identity.</p>
<p>In the
<a href="02-desperately-seeking-erm-librarian.html">Desperately Seeking an ERM Librarian</a>
section,
we reviewed a list of qualifications from current job
advertisements for electronic resource librarian positions.
In Murdock (2010),
we learned how these kinds of qualifications are tied
to various technological developments.
As the technology changes, and it changes a lot
(see <strong>aside</strong> below),
so do the qualifications.
One of the big takeaways from Harnett's (2014) article,
for me at least,
is that conceptual knowledge of the relevant technology
is more important than practical knowledge,
although the two are not always so easily divorced
from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: See The Library Technology Guides' page on
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/mergers/"><em>The History of Mergers and Acquisitions</em></a>
<em>in the Library Technology Industry</em> to get a sense of
how much change has taken place in the last 40+ years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the readings so far,
I think it's safe to say that the work of
electronic resource librarianship is one of
constant disruption.
And by that I mean,
it might be more difficult to find a thread of continuity,
from its early days to now,
in this role than it would be in other areas of
librarianship.
That might be part of what makes this area so interesting,
but it does present some challenges.</p>
<h2 id="framing-2"><a class="header" href="#framing-2">Framing</a></h2>
<p>The first listed reading we have this week is by
Marshall Breeding.
Astute observers will note Breeding is one of the
first cited authors in the two additional readings
we have this week.
We will read more from Breeding later, but
I bring him up now because he oversees a website titled
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/">Library Technology Guides</a>.
If you would like to keep abreast of the recent news
on the electronic resource industry,
Breeding's website should be at the top of your list.</p>
<p>Breeding's <em>What is ERM?</em> article is a good one
to start the week.
He provides an outline of the various components of
electronic resources, and
he provides some historical context for those components.</p>
<h3 id="the-focus-on-academic-libraries-is-misleading"><a class="header" href="#the-focus-on-academic-libraries-is-misleading">The Focus on Academic Libraries is Misleading</a></h3>
<p>One caveat, though:
while all the articles on our list this week are focused on
academic libraries,
the terms, concepts, and processes described
in these articles are relevant to other areas of
librarianship such as public librarianship,
school media librarianship, and so forth.
Differences in processes and in some details will
arise due to organizational or other contextual differences
among these library types.
Organizationally, for example, public libraries are
connected to municipalities, county governments,
state libraries, and to public library consortia.
This presents unique organizational challenges, and
it highlights the fact that municipal, county, or state laws
will define how some processes must be handled and
who must handle them.
The same is true for public schools, and in such cases,
school boards and school districts will likely be involved
(see <strong>aside</strong> below).
Contextual differences that shape electronic resource
management include user communities.
An academic library serves its students, faculty, staff, and
perhaps the public to some degree.
However, a public library serves its local community.
Such differences will shape ERM workflows and other choices,
like the chosen vendors and publishers.
For example, academic libraries provide more scholarly
sources, and public libraries provide more ebooks and
audiobooks and less e-journals.
This means that you might find services like
OverDrive/Libby, Epic, and Hoopla
offered by public libraries but not in academic ones, and
that you will rarely find more advanced scholarly resources
in public libraries.
These differences in needs, due to different communities,
will change the emphasis on some aspects
of the ERM work flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: As an example, see the impact that the current
book bans are having on ebook providers and note all
the parties involved in these situations, including:
superintendents, county officials, county school system,
school district employees, etc.
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/library-apps-book-ban-schools-conservative-parents-rcna26103">NBC News</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reason why our reading lists
lean toward the academic setting is not because
electronic resource management is not relevant to public
or other types of libraries, but it is because
academic librarians publish more about
electronic resources and public librarians publish very little.
For example, I conducted a search in <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/803">LISTA</a>
with the following query,
which returned just three results in 2021 when I first ran
the query and four results in August 2022 when I ran it again.
In fact, a new article wasn't published since the 2021
query. Rather, LISTA just added an addition item from 2015.</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>It does not get much better if I expand the query
to include some additional thesauri terms.
This query returns only six results in 2021 and seven in
2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;PUBLIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>However, if I focus that query on academic libraries,
then the results increase substantially.
The following query returns 51 hits in 2021 and 57 in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And this query returns 82 results in 2021 and 90 in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>We could continue to explore <strong>LISTA</strong> or other databases
for relevant material on ERM and public libraries, and
we would find more.
For example, more results are retrieved when I attach 
terms like <strong>e-resources</strong>, <strong>integrated library systems</strong>,
<strong>discovery platforms</strong>, or <strong>ebooks</strong> to a public library
search in LISTA.
But the results are nearly always much less than
academic library searches.
Another example, my local library system,
<a href="https://lexpublib.org/">Lexington Public Library</a>,
uses the <a href="https://librarytechnology.org/product/carlx/">CARL</a> integrated library system,
but there doesn't appear to be any articles in LISTA
about it since 2015.</p>
<p>Anyway, you get the picture.
There simply isn't a lot of material on
electronic resource management from the
public library perspective, and
a quick search in the school media sphere
mirrors this issue, too.
The following search return zero results in 2021 and in 2022:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;LIBRARY media specialists&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>If you go into public librarianship or
school media librarianship,
I'd encourage you to publish on electronic resources.
It would greatly benefit your peers and those of us
who teach courses like this.</p>
<p>Back to Breeding.
I understand some terms Breeding uses and the technologies
he describes might still be new to us.
Let me spend some time providing some additional
background information and highlighting some things
to look for in these three articles.</p>
<p>Librarians started to migrate to
electronic resource management in the 1970s.
Breeding mentions this.
This is when it happened en masse, but the seeds were
planted well before this.
I published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/pla.2013.0051">a paper</a> a few years ago that
provides a historical account of the first library
automation project,
which took place in the 1930s with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">Hollerith punched cards</a>.
By the 1960s,
the primary use of computers was to manage circulation, and
in the late 60s and early 70s,
library automation focused on managing patron records.
In the early 1970s, tools became available to manage and
search bibliographic records.
Hence, computers were first used mostly to manage the
circulation of books,
then patron records,
which allowed patrons to check out works <em>electronically</em>,
and then we had the ability to search for works.
If a work of interest was located using these tools,
the work could be retrieved from the shelves or ordered
via interlibrary loan by snail mail.
Full text search came much later with the introduction
of better storage media, like CD-ROMs, and
saw major growth with the introduction of the internet to
more institutions in the 1980s
and the web in the early 1990s,
which at its heart is nothing more than a big
document retrieval system.</p>
<p>In the process of migrating from print to electronic,
all sorts of things had to change, but
all that change rests on the major premise of librarianship:
<strong>to provide access by organizing information
in order to retrieve information</strong>.
Although you may have often heard that libraries
are ancient entities,
libraries and librarianship as we understand them today
did not modernize until the late 1800s but more
so starting in the 1920s and 1930s.
It was then that some in the profession began to hone in on
the major complexities and challenges,
social and technological,
involved in <strong>organizing</strong> and <strong>retrieving</strong> information
in order to provide <strong>access</strong>.
The challenges with organizing and retrieving information
that they identified nearly 100 years ago were indeed
major and problematic, but fortuitous,
because it gave rise to what we now called
<em>library science</em>,
the rigorous study of libraries, librarianship, collections,
users, communities, and so forth.</p>
<p>Yet consider when those people laid the groundwork
for a library science nearly 100 years ago,
librarians only managed print and the primary means of
accessing print collections was through a physical building.
With the introduction of computer systems in the 1960s and
with better networking technologies in the 1980s and 1990s,
issues with organizing and retrieving information grew
exponentially, and indeed,
this exponential increase created new complexities and launched
an entire new field, what we now call <em>information science</em>.</p>
<p>All right, back to the ground level.
Let me highlight some key terms in Breeding's article.
They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding aids</li>
<li>Knowledge bases</li>
<li>OpenURL link resolvers</li>
<li>ERM systems</li>
<li>Library service platforms (LSP)</li>
<li>Integrated library systems (ILS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you already have some solid experience
with these things, and even after reading Breeding's
article, these terms may still be abstract.
So, this week, you have two major tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find real, practical examples. Pick one or two of the
above terms and see how they work in practice. Then come
back here and tell us what you found. Use the articles to
help you locate actual products or examples.</li>
<li>Locate how these terms appear in either the Cote and
Ostergaard (2017) article or the Fu and Carmen (2015).
Note other terms that may appear in those two articles
and comment on the role they play in the ERM work flow
and the migration process.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="work-flow"><a class="header" href="#work-flow">Work flow</a></h3>
<p>As you work on this task,
I ask that you pay attention to the emphasis on work flow.
The idea of a <strong>work flow</strong> is a major theme in this course
because it is a major part of
electronic resource management.
We'll come back to the idea over and over this semester.
Also, as we read the Cote and Ostergaard (2017) and
the Fu and Carmen (2015) article,
we will learn about how migrating to new systems is a
major, expensive, and time-consuming project, and
one of the great things about
these two articles is that it documents the work flows
used in these migrations.
If you become involved some day in a migration process,
you should use articles like these to assist you and
to help you make evidence-based decisions about what
you need to accomplish.
And like what these authors have done,
I'd encourage you to document and publish what you learned.
In the print era,
there were some cases where librarians had
to migrate to new systems, too.
For example, some research libraries in the U.S.
started by classifying collections using the
Dewey Decimal Classification system, but
then began to convert to the
Library of Congress Classification system after
the mid-20th century.
This was no small task.
Today, migration is big business in the library world
(see Breeding's site for other examples)
because the technology changes fast and
because there are a number of competing electronic resource
management products that librarians can choose
for their communities,
which they might be inclined to do if the migration
provides an advantage to their users, communities,
and themselves.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-3"><a class="header" href="#introduction-3">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This week we learn about ERM and ILS software.
What are these?</p>
<h2 id="ils-the-integrated-library-system"><a class="header" href="#ils-the-integrated-library-system">ILS, the Integrated Library System</a></h2>
<p><strong>ILS</strong> is an acronym for an <strong>integrated library system</strong>.
We were introduced to the newer term
<strong>library services platform (LSP)</strong>
in the previous section.
Although different in many ways
(<a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/issue/view/509">Breeding, 2015</a>;
<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/25609">Breeding, 2020</a>),
our discussions of the ILS and LSP
this week are relevant
to those types of integrated library systems
that may also be library service platforms,
the latter which are
becoming more common these days.</p>
<p>The differences between ISP and LSP
are both large and small.
The main idea between them is the same
in the sense that they are both
&quot;used by librarians to manage their internal
work and external services,&quot; such as
&quot;acquiring and describing collection resources,
making those resources available to their
users through appropriate channels, and
other areas of their [resource management] operations&quot;
(<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/25609">Breeding, 2020, para. 1</a>).</p>
<h3 id="administration"><a class="header" href="#administration">Administration</a></h3>
<p>In order to provide the above services,
the ILS/LSP has an administrative interface
that librarians use to manage their resources.
The interface contains a set of
modules that are common among most software solutions,
although they may be named variously.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/acquisitions/">acquisitions</a></li>
<li>authority files</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/cataloging/">cataloging</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/circulation/">circulation</a></li>
<li>course reserves</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/opac/">online catalogs</a></li>
<li>patron management</li>
<li>reports</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/serials/">serials</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the above list,
I've linked to documentation on modules provided by
the <a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen</a> open source ILS system.
LibLime's <a href="https://liblime.com/bibliovation/">Bibliovation</a> LSP offers
comparably named modules for 
discovery, circulation, cataloging, serials,
acquisitions, and systems administration.
Other ILS/LSP solutions may offer specific modules
dedicated to other items in the list,
or those functions might be integrated into
one of the above modules.
Alternatively, new modules appear in LSPs
that that take advantage of special LSP abilities
and digital assets.
For example, the <a href="https://exlibrisgroup.com/products/alma-library-services-platform/">Alma LSP</a>
provides modules dedicated to
acquisitions, resources, discovery (via Primo),
fulfillment, administration, and analytics.
Please take a moment and read
about these modules in
<a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen's</a> documentation
and visit the Alma and LibLime links to
learn more about their specifically LSP products.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface"><a class="header" href="#user-interface">User Interface</a></h3>
<p>Each of you are familiar with an
ILS/LSP from a user perspective and
some of you are familiar with these systems
from a librarian perspective.
In your lifetimes, you have used OPACs
(online public access catalogs) or
<strong>discovery systems</strong> like <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY&amp;lang=en">InfoKat</a>,
which uses Alma's Primo discovery system,
you have likely conducted a search for a serial, and
you have most definitely borrowed
a book from a library.
The ILS/LSP makes these end user functions possible.</p>
<p>Until fairly recently,
the <strong>OPAC</strong>
was the primary way to locate and access
items in library collections.
However, in many ILS/LSPs
the OPAC has evolved into a <strong>discovery system</strong>,
depending on what and
how it searches its records and other factors.
The <em>Encyclopedia of Knowledge Organization</em>
describes the differences as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OPACs replicated and extended the functionality of the
card catalogues they largely replaced in providing a
finding aid to the books, journals, audiovisual material
and other holdings of a particular library. The term
<em>discovery system</em> has come into use in the early
Twenty-first century to describe public-facing electronic
catalogues which use the technology of the Internet search
engines to expand the scope of the OPAC to include not
only library-held content, including entries for journal
articles and book chapters that were not typically part of
traditional library catalogues, but also material held
elsewhere which may be of interest to clients
<a href="https://www.isko.org/cyclo/opac">(Wells, 2021)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, OPACS generally searched against
pre-defined fields that are recorded in MARC such as
author, title, subject, etc. and searched collections,
at first print but later electronic, held by the library.
A discovery system can search additional text,
if available, and can more easily link to items
not in the library collection but which can be acquired 
through interlibrary loan.
A discovery system can also integrate with bibliographic
databases and
return results indexed by those databases.
This saves the user from having to know about
specific topical databases.
For example, UK Libraries provides access to
over 700 databases, and
thus having a discovery system that can access
those is beneficial.
However, none of the above mean that a discovery system,
like InfoKat,
is aware of the totality of a library's collections.
(And it's not always clear what's left out.)</p>
<h3 id="in-totality"><a class="header" href="#in-totality">In Totality</a></h3>
<p>These administrative and end user interfaces
make up the totality of the ILS/LSP software.
In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>administrative interface</strong> is used by librarians to
manage tasks provided through modules.</li>
<li>a <strong>public interface</strong>, such as an OPAC or discovery
system, is used by librarians and patrons to access the
library's collections.</li>
</ul>
<p>An ILS/LSP is therefore,
as Stephen Salmon stated in 1975,
a non-traditional way of doing traditional things,
such as &quot;acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation,&quot;
but which is now fairly traditional!</p>
<p>Electronic resource librarians might work extensively with
a resources or like module in order to administer
the library's digital assets (e.g., contracts, etc.),
but all librarians will use one or more of the
ILS/LSP modules.
For example,
when I worked in reference at a small academic library,
I used the Millennium ILS to check out books to users,
to fix borrowing issues,
and to search for works in the OPAC.
Later I primarily used the cataloging module when
I moved to technical services.
What a librarian uses frequently depends
on the organizational structure of a library.
As our reading by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01462679.2014.901200">Miller, Sharp, and Jones (2014)</a> show,
the rise in electronic resources has vastly influenced
the ways librarians structure their organizations,
whose structures were originally informed
by the dictates of a &quot;print-based world&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="erm-the-electronic-resource-management-system"><a class="header" href="#erm-the-electronic-resource-management-system">ERM, the Electronic Resource Management System</a></h2>
<p>ERM is an acronym for <em>electronic resource management system</em>.
Its function is born from the need to manage
a library's <strong>digital assets</strong>,
for example, the licenses that a library has signed.
In order to manage assets like licenses,
the ERM can keep track of the signatories,
the terms of the license/contracts,
specific documents related to these processes,
and more.
An ERM may or may not be integrated
with a library's ILS software.
But it's most likely part of a LSP solution.
The Alma LSP, for example, is a LSP that also provides
<a href="https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/Electronic_Resource_Management">electronic resource management</a>.</p>
<p>Like the ILS/LSP,
ERM software is generally divided into modules
that focus the librarian's work on particular duties
and allow librarians to create work flows and
knowledge management systems.
In an ERM like the open source
<a href="http://coral-erm.org/modules/">CORAL system</a>,
the modules include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/resources/">Resources</a>: a module &quot;provides a robust
database for tracking data related to your organization's
resources ...&quot; and &quot;provides a customizable workflow tool
that can be used to track, assign, and complete workflow
tasks.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/licensing/">Licensing</a>: a module for a &quot;flexible
document management system&quot; that provides options to
manage licensing agreements and to automate parts of the
process.</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/organizations/">Organizations</a>: this module acts as
a type of advanced directory to manage the various
organizations that impact or are involved in the
management of electronic resources, including &quot;publishers,
vendors, consortia, and more.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/usage-statistics/">Usage Statistics</a>: a module providing
librarians with usage statistics of digital assets by
platform and by publisher. Supports COUNTER and SUSHI.
We'll cover COUNTER and SUSHI later in the semester, but
as a preamble:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/about/counter-for-libraries/">COUNTER</a> &quot;sets and maintains the standard
known as the Code of Practice and ensures that
publishers and vendors submit annually to a rigorous
independent audit&quot;, and,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/sushi">SUSHI</a> is a type of protocol to automate
collecting data on usage statistics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/management/">Management</a>: this module provides a
document management system aimed at &quot;storing documents,
such as policies, processes, and procedures, related to
the overall management of electronic resources&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="readings"><a class="header" href="#readings">Readings</a></h2>
<p>In our readings this week,
we have three articles that speak to
ILS/LSP and ERM software solutions
and the relationship between the two.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14955">Fournie (2020)</a> notes,
the electronic resource market is consolidating
into a few heavyweights but that this trend does not
have to force libraries into solutions that
lead to vendor lock-in or acceptance of <em>walled gardens</em>.
In the process, Fournie (2020) describes two
ERM solutions: Coral and Folio.
The author's descriptions are helpful in understanding
what these two software solutions are capable of providing.</p>
<p>The readings by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01462679.2014.901200">Miller, Sharp, and Jones (2014)</a>
and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2020.1717032">Bahnmaier, Sherfey, and Hatfield (2020)</a>
provides some context about how these
technologies impact librarianship.
Miller et al. (2014) describe a case study
(the literature review is also helpful)
that shows how electronic resources have
impacted organizational structure,
job titles, budgets, and more.
Likewise Bahnmaier et al. (2020) discuss aspects of this
as well as reflect on various changes in library staffing
and how this raises the importance of the library-vendor
relationship.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-2">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>With that background in mind,
in this week's forum,

how they function.
Be sure to visit the links in this page,
especially any documentation.
I'll ask that you log into the relevant services,
test the demos sites, or
watch the demo videos.
This will help get some hands-on experience
with them and also demystify what each do.</p>
<h2 id="addendum"><a class="header" href="#addendum">Addendum</a></h2>
<p>In prior semesters, we read articles by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v31i3.1914">Wang and Dawes (2012)</a> and
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2011.10765404">Wilson (2011)</a>.
I replaced those readings for the Fall 2022 semester,
but for those interested,
I briefly describe them below.</p>
<p>In the article by Wang and Dawes (2012),
the authors describe the
&quot;next generation integrated library system&quot;,
which should meet a few criteria that
include the ability to merge ILS software with ERM software.
ERM software solutions exist because
integrated library systems (ILS) failed to include
functions to manage digital assets.
Basically, the ILS was still behaving with a print-mindset,
so to speak, and
was growing stagnant.
Around the time the article was published,
more ILS and ERM software began moving to the cloud,
as was common among many software markets.
This changed the game
because it placed a bigger burden on
software companies to maintain their software.
Based on demand and need,
the LSP was created as a next-generation
ILS that included ERM functionality.
So it's likely that even though the LSP might
replace the ILS/ERM combo someday,
it could be that we'll live in a dual world where
some libraries use a LSP and some use the LSP/ERM combo.</p>
<p>Despite the technical aspects of these solutions,
at its basic,
both ILS/LSP and ERM software solutions focus
on managing assets
(books, serials, <a href="https://archives.yale.edu/subjects/33488">realia</a>, etc)
so that librarians can organize and
users and librarians can retrieve those assets.
There's no requirement to use any solution
offered by a library vendor, and
that's the point of the
Wilson (2011) article,
which shows how regular software can be used
to function as a homegrown solution for
creating and implementing an ERM work flow.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-4"><a class="header" href="#introduction-4">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Awhile ago now,
I conducted some historical research
on a librarian named Ralph Parker.
Inspired by technological advances in automation,
specifically the use of the punched cards and machines,
Parker began to apply this technology
to library circulation processes in the 1930s and
thus became the first person to automate part of the
library's work flow.
By the mid-1960s,
Parker's decades long pursuit of library automation
led to some major advances,
including the founding of <a href="https://www.oclc.org/">OCLC</a>.
Meanwhile, the punched card system he continued to
develop eventually led to massive increases
in circulation and better service to patrons.
In the mid-60s he wrote the following about
the installation and launch of a new punched card system
to help automate circulation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the delight of the patrons it requires only four
seconds to check out materials (as cited in Burns, 2014).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think about that quote often.
When I read that in his annual report in the archives
at the University of Missouri,
I could feel his giddiness with these results.
Until this achievement,
when a patron borrowed an item from the library,
the process involved completing multiple forms
in order to be sure that accurate records were kept.
Accurate record keeping is important.
Libraries need to protect their collections but
also provide access to them.
As stated in the <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027387052">Flexner (1927)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is necessary that the library have control of these
circulating books in several ways. It [the library] must
know where they are, it must lay down rules to see that
thoughtless people do not retain the books in their
possession unfairly, and it must provide means for
securing their prompt return. These and many other
considerations combine to make it necessary for the [
circulation ] department to install and maintain very
efficient methods to control the circulation of books,
which are commonly known as routines (p. 6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What were those routines in the 1930s and thenabouts?
Why was Parker so excited about his system taking
only four seconds to check out a work?
Well, two routines are important for circulation.
The first involves membership and the
second involves charging or checking out works.</p>
<h3 id="membership"><a class="header" href="#membership">Membership</a></h3>
<p>First, if the patron was not yet a member of a library,
then they had to register to become one;
hence, the first routine was to check their membership and
register them as borrowers if they were not yet a member
or if their membership had expired.
If this was a public library,
then the process might vary a bit depending if
the member was an adult or a youth
(or <em>juveniles</em> in the lingo of the time).
Regardless, this routine basically involved completing
an application card, creating a member record and
filing that away for the library's use, and
then giving the borrower a card of their own,
i.e., their <strong>borrower's card</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="charging"><a class="header" href="#charging">Charging</a></h3>
<p>Once membership status was confirmed or created,
then the circulation librarian employed a system
to <strong>charge</strong> books to the borrower.
Several systems had been employed up through the late 1920s,
including the <strong>ledger system</strong>,
the <strong>dummy system</strong>,
the <strong>temporary slip system</strong>,
the <strong>permanent slip or card system</strong>,
the <strong>Browne system</strong>, and
eventually the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Newark%20charging%20system">Newark charging system</a>
(see <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015027387052">Flexner, 1927, pp. 73-82 for details</a>).
Assuming the librarian in the 1930s used
the Newark system,
when a book was to be checked out,
the librarian needed to enter the details on a
&quot;book card, a date slip and a book pocket for each book&quot;
(Flexner, 1927, p. 78).
Flexner goes on to outline the process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The date slip is pasted opposite the pocket at the back of
the book. The date which indicates when the book is due to
be returned or when issued is stamped on each of three
records, the reader's card, the book card and the date
slip. The borrower's number is copied opposite the date on
the book card. The date on the date slip indicates at once
the file in which the book card is to be found, and the
[librarian] assistant is able to discharge the book and
release the borrower immediately on the return of the
volume (Flexner, 1927, pp. 78-79).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence,
charging books or works to patrons involved
a lot of paperwork, and
you can imagine that it might be prone to error.
However, the number of systems at the time and
the discussions and debates around them show
that the processes and routines were steadily
becoming standardized, and
standardization is a necessary pre-requisite to automation.</p>
<p>Parker's achievement in automation eventually
improved the library experience for patrons
as well as the librarians at the circulation desk, and
indirectly their colleagues throughout the library.
That is, once circulation standards stabilized,
and once technology like punched cards
became available generally,
then it became possible to automate this
process for the library.
And this was good;
the effects were that automation increased circulation
and that an automated circulation process
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._R._Ranganathan">Saved The Time Of The Reader</a>,
<em>down to four seconds to be exact!</em></p>
<p>This is all to say that standards and technology
go hand and hand and that the details matter
when thinking about standards.
How does this relationship work?
Standards enable multiple groups of competing
interests to form consensus around
how technologyshould work, and
when this happens,
multiple parties receive payoffs at the expense
of any single party acquiring a monopoly.
This is true for the design of screwdrivers,
the width of railroad tracks,
the temperature scale, and
certainly also for how information is managed and exchanged.
The internet and the web wouldn't exist or
definitely not exist as we know it if not for
the standardization of the Internet Protocol (IP),
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
and other internet and web related technologies
that enable the internet and the web to work
for so many users regardless of the operating system and
the hardware they use.</p>
<h2 id="readings-1"><a class="header" href="#readings-1">Readings</a></h2>
<p>Our first article this week by Harris (2006)
covers the basic reasons for the existence of
<a href="http://www.niso.org/">NISO</a>
(the <em>National Information Standards Organization</em>)
and the kinds of standards NISO is responsible
for maintaining and creating.
These standards are directly related to
libraries and fall under
<a href="https://www.niso.org/welcome-to-niso">three broad categories</a>
related to <strong>Information Creation &amp; Curation</strong>,
<strong>Information Discovery &amp; Interchange</strong>, and
<strong>Information Policy &amp; Analysis</strong>.
There are standards that touch on bibliographic information,
indexing, abstracting, controlled vocabularies, and
many other library important issues.
If you have not before paid attention to NISO,
you might now start seeing more references to the
organization and the standards it publishes,
especially because the international
library community has worked closely with NISO
to develop standards for various aspects of library work.</p>
<p>Another historical note:
As Harris (2006) elaborates in the article,
NISO came into existence in the mid-1930s.
This was about the same time that Ralph Parker
began working on his punched card system.
Not long before this, in the late 1920s,
the first library science graduate program
launched at the University of Chicago, and
in the early 1930s,
the first research based journal started,
<em>The Library Quarterly</em>.
We often hear how long libraries have existed,
and it's true that there were quite a
few accomplishments before the 1930s, but
it is this time period
(for these and a number of other reasons)
that marks the modern era of libraries.</p>
<p>We also are not simply interested in
standardizing things like the forms used
to catalog and charge a book,
to create member records,
to draw up licenses for an electronic resources,
as we'll discuss later.
We are also interested in standardizing,
as Flexner (1927) would say,
&quot;routines&quot;, processes, or workflows.
Thus, our additional readings are on TERMS,
or <em>Techniques for Electronic Resource Management</em>.
TERMS is not a true standard, but
more of a <em>de facto</em> or proposed standard that
helps outline the electronic resource management work flow.
It was developed in order for librarians
or others dealing with electronic resources to come
to a consensus on the processes of
electronic resource management.
Version 1 of TERMS is described by the TERMS authors
in an issue of <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/issue/view/192">Library Technology Reports</a>.
Although it has been replaced by a <a href="http://6terms.tumblr.com/">newer version</a>,
it still functions as a thorough introduction
to the ERM work flow and provides guidance and
suggestions on all aspects of
electronic resource management.
For example, in <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4738/5647">chapter 7</a> of the LTS report
on TERMS version 1,
the authors provide information
on the importance of working with providers or
vendors in case of cancellation of a resource.
They write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not burn any bridges! Many resources have
postcancellation access, which means you need to keep up a
working relationship with suppliers; this might also incur
a platform access fee going forward, so this needs to be
budgeted for in future years. Review the license to fully
understand what your postcancellation rights to access may
be. In addition, you may resubscribe to the resources in
future years. Content is bought and sold by publishers and
vendors. Therefore, you may end up back with your original
vendor a year or two down the line!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of this material is repeated in version 2 of TERMS,
but version 2 was created in order to address changes and
to include more input from the community.
Version 2 also includes a slightly modified outline, and
<a href="https://library.hud.ac.uk/archive/projects/terms/announcing-terms-ver2-0/">includes the following parts</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Investigating new content for purchase or addition</li>
<li>Acquiring new content</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Ongoing evaluation and access, and annual review</li>
<li>Cancellation and replacement review</li>
<li>Preservation</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same link just provided,
they also write about this new version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the works mentioned or cited in the
original TERMS report, much has been written in the past
few years that can help the overwhelmed or incoming
electronic resources librarian manage their daily
workflow. In the end, however, most of the challenges
facing the management of electronic resources is directly
related to workflow management. How we manage these
challenging or complex resources is more important than
what we do, because how we do it informs how successful
and how meaningful the work is, and how well it completes
our goal of getting access to patrons who want to use
these resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such,
the outline and the content described
in these two versions of TERMS is very much centered
on the ERM work flow.
TERMS is a guide and framework for thinking
on the different aspects of the electronic resource
life-cycle within the library, and
it helps provide librarians with a set of questions and
points of investigation.
For example, let's consider Term item 1,
which is to investigate new content
for purchase or addition.
In a presentation by the
<a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/19420/">Emery and Stone (2014)</a>,
they suggest that this involves the following steps,
partly paraphrased:</p>
<ul>
<li>outline what you want to achieve</li>
<li>create a specification document</li>
<li>assemble the right team</li>
<li>review the market and literature and set up trial</li>
<li>speak with suppliers and vendors</li>
<li>make a decision (Emery and Stone, slide 12, 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>Emery and Stone (2014) provide other examples, and
the TERMS listed in this slide are from the first version.
TERM no. 6, PRESERVATION, was added in version 2, and
TERMS nos. 4 and 5 from version 1 were joined together.</p>
<h2 id="exercise"><a class="header" href="#exercise">Exercise</a></h2>
<p>This week you have a two part exercise:</p>
<h3 id="first"><a class="header" href="#first">First</a></h3>
<p>Visit the NISO website and search for documentation
on a standard, recommended practices, or technical reports
and post about it.
The differences between these publications follows:</p>
<p><strong>Technical reports:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NISO Technical Reports provide useful information about a
particular topic, but do not make specific recommendations
about practices to follow. They are thus &quot;descriptive&quot;
rather than &quot;prescriptive&quot; in nature. Proposed standards
that do not result in consensus may get published as
technical reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommended Practices:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NISO Recommended Practices are &quot;best practices&quot; or
&quot;guidelines&quot; for methods, materials, or practices in order
to give guidance to the user. These documents usually
represent a leading edge, exceptional model, or proven
industry practice. All elements of Recommended Practices
are discretionary and may be used as stated or modified by
the user to meet specific needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Published and Approved NISO Standards:</strong></p>
<p>These are the final, approved definitions
that have been achieved by a consensus of the community.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards">https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards</a>
for the descriptions.</p>
<h3 id="second"><a class="header" href="#second">Second</a></h3>
<p>After reading about TERMS,
try to place these TERMS in additional
electronic resource management context.
Please draw from your experience
using the ILS and ERM software,
from the readings,
your personal work experience in a library,
if you have that, or
use your imagination.
Specifically, it would be interesting if
you could pick out aspects of systems
like Coral or Folio that appear
to facilitate standardized workflows.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-5"><a class="header" href="#introduction-5">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>In this section we cover what it means for technology
to be interoperable using OpenURL link resolvers.</p>
<h2 id="problem"><a class="header" href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>
<p>We take it for granted that,
on the open web,
we can seamlessly follow links to
websites and webpages,
or do so without too much fuss.
It gets more complicated
when we want access to works that are behind paywalls,
despite where such works have been found:
search engines, bibliographic databases,
OPACs, or discovery services.
In such cases,
direct links to such sources will not always work.</p>
<p>The complication is that,
when a library subscribes to a
journal or a magazine,
access to that journal or magazine
is provided through
various services and not necessarily through the
publisher's default site.
Also, libraries provide multiple discovery points and
multiple ways to access the same works,
such as through bibliographic databases
with overlapping scopes.
Bibliographic databases can tell
us that an item exists when we search for it,
but a library may not subscribe to the publication
or the item might be in the stacks,
stored off site or at another library altogether.
All these problems,
in conjunction with the paywalled problem,
which necessitates additional layers,
like proxy servers that function to authenticate
library users,
complicate access.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example.
The journal <em>Serials Librarian</em> is published
by <em>Taylor &amp; Francis Online</em> / <em>Routledge</em>, and
has the following site as its homepage:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/wser20">https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/wser20</a></p>
<p>The journal is indexed in <em>EBSCOhost</em>'s
<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/803">Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts</a>
(LISTA) database and in <em>ProQuest</em>'s
<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/3355">Social Science Premium Collection</a> (SSPC) database,
among other places
(e.g., it can also be found in <em>Google Scholar</em>,
<em>Google Search</em>, a library's discovery platform,
and more).
This means that an article like the following
can show up based on a query on any of the above platforms,
even if none of these search or discovery platforms provide
full text access to the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brown, D. (2021). &quot;Through a glass, darkly:: Lessons learned
starting over as an electronic resources librarian. <em>The
Serials Librarian, 81</em>(3–4), 246–252.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2021.2008581">https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2021.2008581</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One way to know if our library provides access
to the above source and others like it is 
through a link resolver.
We see UK's link resolver in action whenever
we see a <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> button or link.
When we click on that button or link in
someplace like LISTA or SSPC,
we trigger the database's role in the link resolver
for that article,
and that routes us through
the library's discovery service.
In <em>LISTA</em>, that link looks like this:</p>

(scroll to the right to view their entirety),
you can see that the article's <strong>metadata</strong> is
embedded in the URLs.
Among other things, you can see the
publication title, the article title,
the author's name, the DOI, and more.</p>
<p>That metadata is used to trigger a search
query in the library's discovery platform
(at UK, that's <em>InfoKat Discovery</em> by <em>Primo</em>).
It specifically initiates a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">GET HTTP Request</a>,
which is designed to request data from a resource/server,
in this case <em>InfoKat Discovery</em>, using
the metadata embedded in the URLs
as seen above.</p>
<p>This is the work of an OpenURL link resolver,
among other technologies,
which are designed to provide access
to a <em>target</em> despite their <em>source</em> by
initiating queries in an OPAC or discovery
platform using the metadata embedded in a URL.</p>
<p>This is a technical solution to the paywall problem
that is designed to help users of
electronic resources access a source in a
library's collection based on a citation/record
discovered in a search result,
an article's list of references,
or wherever else the link resolver might show up.
It is meant to work for all items in a library's collection,
including print items,
since print items have records in the catalog
or discovery service.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases"><a class="header" href="#use-cases">Use Cases</a></h2>
<h3 id="google-scholar-example"><a class="header" href="#google-scholar-example"><em>Google Scholar</em> Example</a></h3>
<p>Let's imagine a search in <em>Google Scholar</em>,
and that as a result of this search,
we identify a paywalled article
that we wish to retrieve from the library.
If we have made <em>Google Scholar</em> aware that
we are affiliated with a specific library,
by that affiliation <em>Google Scholar</em> becomes
aware of a library's collections
(through a knowledge base).
Then <em>Google Scholar</em> will use a library's link
resolver service to retrieve a target
from a library's collections using the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The metadata about the article will be extracted from
<em>Google Scholar</em> (aka, the <em>source</em>).</li>
<li>More metadata will be added about the institution
(administrative metadata, like an institutional ID
number).</li>
<li>The metadata is converted into a URL query that queries
the library's collections in the discovery service, and</li>
<li>The user is then presented with <em>target</em> options (or
taken directly to the work) for retrieving the article.
<ul>
<li>the options may include full text access from various
and possibly multiple vendors or publishers,
information about the physical location (e.g., on the
shelves) if it exists there, or options to request the
work through interlibrary loan. Ideally, it will lead
the user directly to the full text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>To link <em>Google Scholar</em> to an affiliation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://scholar.google.com">https://scholar.google.com/</a></li>
<li>Open Settings</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Library Links</strong> tab</li>
<li>Search for your affiliation
<ul>
<li>e.g., University of Kentucky</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add and save</li>
</ol>
<p>Now when you search in <em>Google Scholar</em>,
you should see <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> links
(if your affiliation is University of Kentucky)
next to search results that your affiliation has
in its collections.</p>

<p>Consider a basic keyword search in
<em>Google Scholar</em> for the term <code>electronic resources</code>.
One of the first items listed in the
results page is an article titled
&quot;Electronic resources: access and usage
at Ashesi University College.&quot;
If we've connected our library to <em>Google Scholar</em>,
then we should see a <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link to the
right of our search result list.
In the following OpenURL,
we can see the article's metadata and
also that <em>google</em> is the <em>source</em>
(just as we could see that
<em>ebscohost</em> and <em>proquest</em> were the
sources in the URLs above).</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01SAA_UKY/01SAA_UKY:UKY?sid=google&amp;auinit=PS&amp;aulast=Dadzie&amp;atitle=Electronic+resources:+access+and+usage+at+Ashesi+University+College&amp;id=doi:10.1108/10650740510632208
</code></pre>
<p>Full text for that article is
provided by <em>Emerald eJournals Premier</em>,
and <em>Emerald</em> is the original publisher
of this journal and provides the 
original view of the article.
That means that <em>Primo</em> next hands off our query
to UK Library's proxy service,
<strong>EZProxy</strong>,
which asks us to authenticate ourselves
with our university account login information,
and then takes us to a copy of that full text
from the provider.
The article is also available as full text through
two <em>ProQuest</em> databases, but
Emerald's view takes precedence since it's
the original publisher.</p>
<p>If other resources provided access,
like the <em>EBSCOhost</em> and <em>ProQuest</em> databases,
and not the original publisher,
like <em>Emerald</em>,
we would stop on <em>Primo</em> and
be offered to select which database we
would like to use to view the full text.</p>
<p>In our case,
since we only have one option,
the <em>Primo</em> to EZProxy to the <em>Emerald</em> full text view
transfers happen quickly.</p>
<h2 id="dissecting-an-openurl"><a class="header" href="#dissecting-an-openurl">Dissecting an OpenURL</a></h2>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the <em>Primo</em> URL.
By looking at its components,
we see that it's an OpenURL link,
and we can see the fields and values and
identify the metadata.
The percent signs and numbers in the title field use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">Percent-encoding</a>.
Percent-encoding is a process used to 
encode characters that are URL unfriendly,
like empty spaces between words,
into characters that can be parsed.
See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp">this page</a> for a table of
UTF-8 percent-encodings and the characters they match.
I have inserted newlines into the <em>Primo</em> link below
to enable readability:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?
institution=01SAA_UKY&amp;
vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY&amp;
aulast=Dadzie&amp;

auinit=PS&amp;
atitle=Electronic%20resources%20access%20and%20usage%20at%20Ashesi%20University%20College&amp;
sid=google
</code></pre>
<p>The link resolver technology translates the metadata
embedded in the above link as needed for
the appropriate service.
The <strong>institution</strong>, <strong>vid</strong>, and <strong>sid</strong> fields
are administrative metadata that identify 
the source information.
The key fields used to retrieve the record
for this source are the:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aulast</strong> for author's last name</li>
<li><strong>id</strong> for the DOI</li>
<li><strong>auinit</strong> for the author's first two initials</li>
<li><strong>atitle</strong> for the article title</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-case-of-interlibrary-loan"><a class="header" href="#in-case-of-interlibrary-loan">In Case of Interlibrary Loan</a></h3>
<p>We can see another instance of this within <em>Primo</em> itself.
Here I search for the phrase <code>electronic resources</code>
and filter by <em>WorldCat</em> options
from the drop down box to the right of the search box.
By filtering for <em>WorldCat</em> options,
I'm more likely to retrieve records that are
not in UK Library's collections.</p>
<p>The first option is a work titled
<strong>Electronic Resources.
Selection and bibliographic control.</strong>
Since this is not available via UK Libraries,
I would have to request the item
through interlibrary loan.
When I do that, 
the link resolver triggers
<a href="https://support.atlas-sys.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011910073-OpenURL-Configuration">ILLiad</a>,
which is used for interlibrary loan.
Note how the OpenURL looks much different here.
Essentially, the OpenURL is contextual, and
its context reflects the service being used
(i.e., <em>EBSCOhost</em>, <em>ProQuest</em>, <em>Google Scholar</em>,
<em>Primo</em>, <em>Illiad</em>, etc.) which determines
the metadata elements in the URL.
Note that some elements are empty
(e.g., <strong>rft.date=&amp;</strong> is an empty value for the date field 
versus <strong>rft.genre=book&amp;</strong>, which holds the value <strong>book</strong>
for the genre field).</p>

<p>Our readings this week by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2012.652480">Kasprowski (2012)</a>,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2015.999519">Johnson et al. (2015)</a>, and
by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2017.1304765">Chisari et al. (2017)</a>
discuss link resolver technology,
migration to new link resolver services, and
methods to evaluate link resolver technology
from both the systems and a user's perspective.
It may not be necessary to learn how to hack
your way through the OpenURL syntax,
as I have above (or below: See Appendix A),
or other aspects of link resolver URL formatting,
but it is a good idea to acquire a basic
understanding of how the URLs work in this process.</p>
<p>Let me re-emphasize that the key way that
link resolvers work is by embedding citation metadata
within the link resolver URL,
including administrative metadata.
This is another reason to have high quality
metadata for our records,
as our readings note.
By implication, if we find,
perhaps by an email from a library patron,
that a link has broken in this process,
it might be that the metadata is incorrect or
has changed in some important way.
Knowing the parts of this process aids us in
deciphering possible errors that exist when the
technology breaks.</p>
<p>For this week, see the <em>ExLibres Alma</em>
link resolver documentation,
which is the link resolver product used by UK Libraries.
Let's discuss this documentation in the forum.
I want you to find and explain other
instances of link resolvers.
Be sure to provide links to these examples and
articulate ways the technology can be evaluated.</p>

<p>Since OpenURL compatible link resolver technology
is partly based on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">query strings</a>,
as we have seen,
we can glean all sorts of information
by examining these URLs:
the query string component that contains
the metadata for the source but
also the base component that
contains the vendor and institutional information
and also the URL type.
When I worked on this section,
I was able to learn that <em>Primo/Alma</em>
uses two URL types to request resources:
a search URL and an OpenURL.
We can see this the URLs.
The base search URL looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?
</code></pre>
<p>The base OpenURL differs just a bit (see the end of the URL):</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?
</code></pre>
<p>The base search URL appears when
searching the university's discovery service.
However, the OpenURL only appears when needed and
during transit between the source and
before reaching the target:
e.g., after clicking on a <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link and
before being redirected to the full text version.
I copied my institution's
specific OpenURL when I clicked on a
<strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link and before it redirected
to the <a href="https://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html">EZproxy</a> page.</p>
<p>My students often identify great problems to solve
or are the source of great ideas.
In a previous semester,
one of my students in my
electronic resource management class
noticed that <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> has a
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/locate">locate menu</a>
that uses OpenURL resolvers to look up items in a library.
By default, Zotero uses <em>WorldCat</em>, but
it can use a specific institution's OpenURL resolver.
I had completely forgotten about this.
When I investigated whether my institution was listed
in the Zotero locate menu,
I found that it was not nor was it
listed on Zotero's page of
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/locate/openurl_resolvers">OpenURL resolvers</a>.</p>
<p>At the time,
I didn't know what my institution's exact OpenURL was, but
I was able to figure it out by comparing
the syntax and values from other Primo URLs listed on
Zotero's page of OpenURL resolvers.
By comparing these OpenURLs,
I was able to derive my institution's specific OpenURL
(base component plus institutional info), which is:</p>
<pre><code>https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?institution=01SAA_UKY&amp;vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY
</code></pre>
<p>I added that to Zotero, and it worked, and
then I posted the OpenURL info to Zotero's forum, and
they've added it to their OpenURL resolver page.
If others are curious about how to add this info to Zotero,
<a href="https://library.sacredheart.edu/zotero/advanced/usingLibraryLookup">another library</a>
has created a video on this.
The directions cover adding a specific OpenURL to Zotero
and on how to use Zotero's Library Lookup functionality.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-b"><a class="header" href="#appendix-b">Appendix B</a></h2>
<h3 id="a-basic-url"><a class="header" href="#a-basic-url">A Basic URL</a></h3>
<p>I mentioned query strings above.
Theses are a part of a URL that
include instructions to query
engines, database, or websites
(like <em>Wikipedia</em>).
The parameters (i.e., search terms)
are part of a query string, too.
It's also important to 
understand the base part of a URL (link) because
the <strong>link</strong> in link resolver is the
part of the whole process.
A URL for an  article can looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/10650740510632208/full/html
</code></pre>
<p>This URL contains the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>https:// : indicates the secure hypertext transfer
protocol (HTTP)</li>
<li>www      : indicates the subdomain</li>
<li>emerald  : indicates the second level domain name</li>
<li>.com     : indicates the top level domain</li>
</ul>
<p>Under a standard configuration,
the rest of the URL indicates directory (or folder)
location information on the <em>emerald.com</em> server.
The following suggests
that the article is seven directories (or folders) deep on
the <em>emerald.com</em> server:</p>
<ul>
<li>/insight/content/doi/10.1108/10650740510632208/full/html</li>
</ul>
<p>The DOI (digital object identifier)
for this article is part of the above URL and
is specifically
<code>10.1108/10650740510632208</code>.
The DOI is composed of a <a href="https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html">prefix and a suffix</a>.
The prefix includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 : this is the directory indicator</li>
<li>1108 : the registrant code for this specific journal</li>
</ul>
<p>The suffix refers to the following element:</p>
<ul>
<li>10650740510632208 : a character string (in this case, of
numbers) that refers to the article. This string is
created by the registrant</li>
</ul>
<p>The DOI itself can be used to create a permanent URL
for the above work be adding a <strong>https://doi.org/</strong>
to the beginning:</p>

<h2 id="introduction-6"><a class="header" href="#introduction-6">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><strong>Access</strong> is the paramount
principle of librarianship, and
all other issues,
from censorship to
information retrieval or
to usability,
are on some level derived from or framed
by that principle of <strong>Access</strong>.</p>
<p>This week we devote ourselves
to a discussion of <strong>electronic access</strong>.
To start, let's begin with
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00987913.2014.929483">Samples and Healy (2014)</a>,
who provide a nice framework
for thinking about
managing electronic access.
They include two broad categories,
<em>proactive troubleshooting</em> and
<em>reactive troubleshooting</em> of access.</p>
<ul>
<li>proactive troubleshooting of access: &quot;defined as troubleshooting access
problems before they are identified by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;letting public-facing library staff know about planned database
downtime&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;doing a complete inventory to make sure that every database paid for is
in fact 'turned on'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reactive troubleshoot of access: &quot;defined as troubleshooting access issues as
problems are identified and reported by a patron&quot;. Some examples include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;fixing broken links&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;fixing incorrect coverage date ranges in the catalog&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;patron education about accessing full text&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal here, as suggested by
Samples and Healy (2014),
is to maximize
proactive troubleshooting and
to minimize reactive troubleshooting.
The Samples and Healy (2014)
report is a great example
of systematic study.
The authors identify a problem that
had grown &quot;organically,&quot;
collected and analyzed data, and
then generalized from it by outlining
a &quot;detailed workflow&quot;
to &quot;improve the timeliness and
accuracy of electronic resource work.&quot;
Practically, studies like
this promise to improve
productivity and work flows
and foster job and
patron satisfaction.
Such studies also help
librarians identify the kinds of
software solutions that align
with their own
workflows and patron
information behaviors.
If interested,
I suggest reading
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2021.1949162">Lowe et al., 2021</a>
about the impact of Covid-19
on electronic resource management.
Six authors individually
describe access issues
at their respective institutions and
show how issues of
pricing, acquisitions, training,
user expectations, and
budgets affect electronic access.
I suggest reading articles
like this in light of the
framework provided
by Samples and Healy (2014)
because stories like these,
about this impact of the
pandemic on electronic access,
can help guide us in
developing proactive troubleshooting
procedures minimize
future issues,
pandemic or otherwise,
at our own institutions.</p>
<p>Samples and Healy (2014)
say something important against a common
assumption about electronic resources,
particularly those provided by vendors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impression that once a resource is acquired, it is then just 'accessible'
belies the actual, shifting nature of electronic resources, where continual
changes in URLs, domain names, or incompatible metadata causes articles and
ebooks to be available one day, but not the next (<em>The Complexity of ERM</em>
section, para. 6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, unlike a printed work
from the long ago print-only era that,
once cataloged,
may be shelved for decades or longer
without major problems of access,
electronic resources require
constant and active attention
to maintain accessibility to them.
Ebooks, for example,
can create metadata problems.
For example,
often what's important
about scholarly ebooks,
in particular,
are the chapters they include, and
hence metadata describing
ebook components is important,
along with providing links to
those chapters in discovery systems.
This difference between
item-level cataloging and
title-level cataloging,
as Samples and Healy describe,
can lead to confusing and problematic
results when considering
different genres
and what those genres contain.</p>
<p>Or, note that they discuss how
a series of links are involved
starting from the source of discovery,
e.g., an OPAC or a discovery layer,
to the retrieved item, and
how difficult it might be in
determining which of these links and
which of those services
is broken when
access becomes problematic.</p>
<p>Let me highlight a few key findings from their report:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workflows</strong>: why does this keep coming up? It's because workflows help
automate a process---simplify and smooth out what needs to be done, and
because this is only possible when things are standardized.</li>
<li><strong>Staffing</strong>: we'll discuss this more in another section, but part of the
problem here is that ERM has had a major impact on organizational structure,
but one where different libraries have responded differently. This lack of
organizational standardization has its benefits regarding overall management
practices and cultures, but it also has huge drawbacks---and that's the
difficulty in establishing effective, generalized workflows that include key
participants, and to minimize as many dependencies on any one person.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking</strong>: if there's no tracking, there's no method to systematically
identify patterns in problems. And if that's not possible, then there's no
method to solve those problems proactively. It becomes all reactive
troubleshooting, and reactive troubleshooting, as Samples and Healy indicate,
results in poor patron experiences. We'll discuss tracking when we during the
week on Evaluation and Statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We commonly get the line
that discovery systems are a
great solution
to all the disparate
resources that
librarians subscribe to.
Or, if we do think about
problems with such systems,
we are often presented with a
basic information retrieval problem,
such that the larger the collection to search,
the more likely a relevant
item will get lost in the mix.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2017.1270096">Carter and Traill (2017)</a>
point out that these discovery systems
also tend to reveal
access problems as they are used.
The authors provide a checklist
to help track issues and improve
existing workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5860/lrts.60n1.23">Buhler and Cataldo (2016)</a>
provide an important reminder
that the mission of the
electronic resource librarian
is to serve the patron.
This should remind us that the
internet and the web
have flattened genres.
By that I mean they
have made it difficult
to distinguish among works 
like magazine articles, news articles,
journal articles, encyclopedia articles,
ebooks, etc.
Though the Buhler and Cataldo (2016)
reading is student-focused,
other studies have hinted
at the same issue they describe
across other populations.
It's important,
if possible,
to recognize these issues as
ERM librarians and
work to resolve them
in the ways that you
would be able to.</p>
<p>Myself, I grew up learning about
the differences between
encyclopedia articles, journal articles,
magazine articles, newspaper articles,
book chapters, handbooks,
indexes, and dictionaries
because I grew up with
the print versions,
which by definition,
were tangible things
that looked different from each other.
Today, a traditional first year
college student was born
around the year 2004 and
grew up reading sometime
in the last decade.
The problem this raises is that
although electronic resources
are electronic or digital,
they are still based on genres
that originated in the print age,
yet they lack the
physical characteristics that
distinguished one from the other.
E.g., what's the difference
between a longer
<em>NY Times</em> article
(traditionally a newspaper article) and
an article in the <em>New Yorker</em>
(traditionally a magazine article) today
in their online forms?
Aside from some aesthetic differences
between the two,
they are both presented on web pages,
and it's not altogether obvious,
based on any kind of cursory examination,
that we can tell,
as regular users,
that they're entirely different genres.
However, there are important
informational differences between the two,
how they were written,
how they were edited,
how long they are,
and who they were written by
that might still lead us to
consider them as different genres.
Even <em>Wikipedia</em> articles pose this problem.
Citing an encyclopedia article was
never an accepted practice,
but this was only true
for general encyclopedias.
It was generally okay
to cite articles from
special encyclopedias because
they focused on limited subject matters
like art, music, science, culture, and
were usually more in-depth in their coverage.
Examples include the
<em>Encyclopedia of GIS</em>,
the <em>Encyclopedia of Evolution</em>,
<em>The Kentucky African American Encyclopedia</em>,
<em>The Encyclopedia of Virtual Art Carving Toraja--Indonesia</em>,
and so forth.
There are studies that show that
<em>Wikipedia</em> provides the same
kind of in-depth coverage
of some special encyclopedias,
thus helping
to flatten the encyclopedia genre, too.</p>
<p>The flattening holds
true for things like <em>Google</em>.
The best print analogy for <em>Google</em>
is that of an index,
which was used to locate
keywords that would
<em>refer</em> to source material.
The main difference
between these indexes and <em>Google</em>
is that the indexes were
produced to cover specific publications,
like a newspaper,
or specific areas,
like the <em>Social Science Citation Index</em> or
the <em>Science Citation Index</em>,
both of which are
actual, documented, historical precursors
to <em>Google</em> and to <em>Google Scholar</em>.
But today, these search engines
are erroneously considered source material
(e.g, &quot;I found it on Google&quot;).
Few, I think, would have considered
a print index as source material,
but rather as a <strong>reference</strong> item,
since it <em>referred</em> users to sources.
Nowadays, it's all mixed up,
but who can blame anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Example print indexes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6wqu02M7OQzyJnCG2">Photos of the New York Times Index</a></li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JpnqxzZ44dhM06cq2">Photos of the Newspaper Index for the Washington Post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Y5ronALog63zIxwr1">Photos of the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="access-and-authentication"><a class="header" href="#access-and-authentication">Access and Authentication</a></h2>
<p>Let's spend some a bit of time
on the technologies around
and access and authentication.
Much of what exists in a
library's electronic collections is paywalled,
therefore librarians use software
that authenticates users before
they acquire access.
This is generally required
in agreements with content vendors.</p>
<p>There are two main technologies
used to authenticate users.
The first is through an IP / proxy server.
Here, <a href="https://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html">EZproxy</a> (OCLC)
is the main 
product in this arena, and
in fact we use EZproxy at UK.
When we access any paywalled work,
like a journal article,
you may notice
the <strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong>
string of text in a URL.
For example,
the following is an EZProxy URL:</p>
<pre><code>https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/science/article/pii/S030645730500004X
</code></pre>
<p>The interesting thing about
this URL is that it has a
<strong>uky.edu</strong> address even
though the article is in
a journal that's
hosted in Elsevier's
<em>ScienceDirect</em> database.
The <strong>www-sciencedirect-com</strong>
part of the address is
a simple subdomain of
<strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong>
(you can tell because
the components are separated
by dashes instead of periods),
As a subdomain,
it is no different than
the <strong>www</strong> in <strong>www.google.com</strong> or
the <strong>maps</strong> in <strong>maps.google.com</strong>.
The original URL is
in fact:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645730500004X
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to the first URL,
the interesting thing about
the original URL is that it
is in fact a 
<strong>sciencedirect.com</strong> address.
Even though &quot;sciencedirect&quot;
appears in the <strong>uky.edu</strong> URL,
it is not a &quot;sciencedirect.com&quot; server.
They are two different servers,
from two different organizations,
and are as different as
<strong>uky.edu</strong> and <strong>google.com</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason we read an article
or some other paywalled content
at a <strong>uky.edu</strong> address and not
at a, e.g.,
<strong>sciencedirect.com</strong> address
is because of the way
proxy servers work.
In essence,
when we make a request for
a resource,
like a journal article or
a bibliographic database,
that's provided by a library,
our browser makes the request
to the proxy server and not
to the original server.
The proxy server then
makes the resource request
to the original server,
which relays that content
back to the proxy server (EZproxy),
which then sends 
the content to our browser.
This means that when we request
an article in a journal
at sciencedirect.com or jstor.com,
our browser never actually makes
a connection to those servers.
Instead, the proxy server
acts as a go-between.
See <a href="https://libtechlaunchpad.com/2017/04/25/proxy-servers-basics-and-resources/">Day (2017)</a>
for a more technical
and yet accessible
description of the process.</p>
<p>Proxy servers provide access
either through a login server
or based on the user's IP address.
If we're on campus,
then our authentication is
IP based,
since all devices attached
to the university's network
are assigned an IP
from a pre-defined
range of IP addresses.
This makes access to paywalled
content fairly seamless,
when on campus.</p>
<p>If we are off-campus,
access is authenticated
via a login method to
the proxy server.
When we attempt to access
paywalled content from off-campus,
we will see an EZproxy login URL.
This looks something like this
for accessing the
<em>ScienceDirect</em> database:</p>
<pre><code>http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://www.sciencedirect.com
</code></pre>
<p>Aside from <em>ScienceDirect</em>,
you can see a list of other
subscribed content that requires
EZproxy authentication here:</p>
<pre><code>https://login.ezproxy.uky.edu/menu
</code></pre>
<p>The second main technology
used to authenticate and
provide access
is based on what is
called SAML authentication.
The main product that provides
SAML authentication for libraries is
<a href="https://www.openathens.net/">OpenAthens</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike a proxy / IP
authentication process,
SAML is a type of identity
verification system.
Under this method,
libraries offer a single sign-on
process, and
once authenticated,
patrons have access to
all SAML ready
content or service providers.
The process is similar to
the <a href="https://duo.com/docs/sso-generic">Duo Single Sign-On</a>
service our university
uses for authentication.
In the OpenAthens case,
users are authenticated via
an identity provider,
which would be the library
or the broader institution
(and usually via some
other software service).
The library provides identification
by connecting to its organization's
identity management system,
such as <em>adfs</em>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services">Active Directory Federation Services</a>.
Once a patron has been authenticated,
a confirmation is sent to the
content provider, which
then provides access to
the content to the patron.
For more details,
see <a href="https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml">What is SAML?</a> and
this detailed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o4syOJsIf0">OpenAthens software demo</a>.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of this method
is that URLs are not proxied,
which means that content is not
delivered to the patron
from a proxy server like  EZproxy.
Instead, patrons access the
original source directly.
From a patron's perspective,
this makes sharing URLs nicer.
As far as I can tell,
one of the downsides might
be privacy related.
With a proxy server,
users don't access the
original source, but
instead the source is delivered
through the proxy server,
which by definition,
masks the patron's IP address
and browser information.
This wouldn't be true under
the SAML method.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-3"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-3">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The Samples &amp; Healy (2014) and
the Carter &amp; Traill (2017) articles
address troubleshooting strategies 
with electronic resources.
One additional thing to note
about these readings is
how the organizational structure
influences workflows and how
the continued transition from
a print-era model of library processes
to an electronic one remains problematic.
Even once that transition is complete,
both readings make the case that
strategy and preparation are
needed to deal with these issues.
The Buhler &amp; Cataldo (2016) article
shows how confusing e-resources
are to patrons and
how the move to digital has
complicated all genres,
or &quot;containers&quot;, as
the authors name them.
Such &quot;ambiguity&quot; has
implications not only for
how users find and identify
electronic resources but
on how librarians manage
access to them.</p>
<p>I added the
EZproxy and OpenAthens
content in order to complete
the technical discussions we
have had in recent weeks on
integrated library systems, 
electronic resource management systems,
link resolvers,
and standards.
These authentication and access
technologies complete these discussions,
which, altogether,
cover the major technologies
that electronic resource librarians
work with to provide access
to paywalled content in library
collections.
Both technologies aim to
provide seamless access to
paywalled content, as
nearly as seamless as accessing
content via a search engine or
other source.
Although neither will never be
able to offer completely seamless
access as long there are paywalled
sources in library collections,
the job of an electronic resource
librarian is often to make sure
they work as well as possible.
This will often mean working 
with vendors and colleagues.</p>

<p>This chapter will be updated (8/20/2022).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="workflow"><a class="header" href="#workflow">Workflow</a></h1>
<p>If all goes according to plan, this week's readings on electronic resource
management and on workflow analysis should help put prior material into context
and act as a bridge to the material we will discuss in much of the remaining
weeks of the semester.</p>
<p>In the first three weeks of the semester, we learned about and discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>what it means to be a librarian who oversees or is a part of electronic resource management,</li>
<li>what kinds of criteria are sought for in new hires, and</li>
<li>why electronic resources have introduced so much <em>constant disruption</em> across libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>This latter point is largely due to, among other things, the fact that the
print-era involved largely (or at least more so) a linear process of collection
management that was fundamentally altered with the introduction of electronic
resources.</p>
<p>Then we discussed the differences between:</p>
<ul>
<li>electronic resource management software and</li>
<li>integrated library system software. </li>
</ul>
<p>We also learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical and workflow standards</li>
</ul>
<p>And we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>why both types of the above standards are important,</li>
<li>why interoperability is required, and</li>
<li>what happens when access to electronic resources break.</li>
</ul>
<p>This week things will start to make connections at a faster pace. In the first
Anderson article (chapter 2), we gain a clearer idea of what a knowledge base
is and how it works, and we learn more about how integrated library systems and
ERM systems work together (or fail to). We also dip our toes into newer topics
like licensing, COUNTER, and SUSHI, which we'll cover in greater detail in the
next few weeks.</p>
<p>In the second Anderson article (chapter 3), we learn how to take careful
consideration of a library's work flow before selecting which ERM software to
purchase. This is why workflow based standards are important, even if they are
not true technical standards. We do this because we select systems based on the
needs of the librarians, which may be vastly different across libraries, and
which must rely on different aspects of the overall process. As you read this
chapter, I want you to keep in mind the Samples and Healy article from the
previous week's reading.</p>
<p>As hinted at in these readings, especially in the section on acquisitions,
budget, subscription, and purchasing in chapter two but also in the multiple
discussions about the role vendors play in electronic resource management, the
market and the economics of this area of librarianship weigh heavily on
everyday realities. We will follow up on this next week when we begin to read
more about the market and the economics of electronic resources. For example,
in our Anderson readings this week, we learn about the CORE recommended
practice (RP), or the <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/core-cost-resource-exchange">Cost of Resource Exchange</a>, that was
developed by NISO. CORE brings together three aspects of our previous
discussions: software, funds, and interoperability. Here the CORE RP describes
how the ILS and ERM systems can communicate the costs of electronic resources
between each other. Its existence hints at the pressures librarians have had in
having to deal with complex budget issues. Although this is not touched on in
these articles, the current pandemic will make these issues more complicated
for libraries.</p>
<p>While we spent time discussing technical standards, we also learned about
TERMS, an attempt to standardize the language and processes involved with
electronic resource management. We see more connections in this week's
readings. Aside from the CORE standard, we learn more about standard attempts
at licensing, and the <em>COUNTER</em> and <em>SUSHI</em> statistic-related standards, which
provide standards for the communication, collection, presentation, and the
formatting of usage statistics for electronic resources such as ebooks,
journals, databases, and more.</p>
<p>We have also discussed interoperability, and what it takes for multiple systems
to connect and transfer content between each other. We primarily discussed this
with respect to link resolver technology, and we did this not just because we
should know about link resolvers as important components of electronic resource
management, but also because link resolvers are a good example of the kind of
work that is involved for systems to communicate properly. There are other
forms of interoperability, though, and coming back to <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/core-cost-resource-exchange">CORE</a>
again, the Anderson article (chapter 2) provides a link to a white paper
titled, <a href="https://old.diglib.org/standards/ERMI_Interop_Report_20080108.pdf">White Paper on Interoperability between Acquisitions Modules of
Integrated Library Systems and Electronic Resource Management
Systems</a>, and this paper defines the 13 data elements that were
determined to be desired in any exchange between ILS software and ERM software
for these software to communicate usefully with each other. By that, I mean,
the data points enable meaningful use of both the ILS software and the ERM
software, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>purchase order number</li>
<li>price</li>
<li>start/end dates</li>
<li>vendor</li>
<li>vendor ID</li>
<li>invoice number</li>
<li>fund code</li>
<li>invoice date</li>
<li>selector</li>
<li>vendor contact information</li>
<li>purchase order note</li>
<li>line item note</li>
<li>invoice note (White Paper ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>That white paper contains example and worthwhile use cases and stories from
major libraries, and these cases are rather helpful reads. You are not required
to read this paper, but I urge you to skim through it to get a sense of how
standards are created through a process of comparing and contrasting and
coordinating needs and contexts among different entities. The link is in the
transcript but also in the reading, as well as the link to the actual <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/core-cost-resource-exchange">CORE
protocol</a>:</p>
<p>I really like our two readings by Anderson because they are illustrative of the
whole ERM process. If you are able, visit the issue these two readings are from
and read the other chapters that Anderson has written.</p>
<p>In short, this week's topic will also, if all goes well, help provide a
foundation for the remaining weeks, when we will learn about and discuss things
like licensing and negotiation and evaluation and statistics in more detail.
Think of this week as a transition between the first part of the semester and
what happens next.</p>

<h2 id="copyright-and-budgets"><a class="header" href="#copyright-and-budgets">Copyright and Budgets</a></h2>
<p>This week we're reading a piece on the ebook market (Sanchez, 2015), and one on
the academic journal market (Bosch, Albee, &amp; Henderson, 2018). We'll learn how
each impacts library budgets.</p>
<p>To understand Sanchez's article, we need to address some copyright topics. In
the next part of this lecture, I'll discuss copyright, the first sale doctrine,
and show how digital works have disrupted some basic ways that libraries
function. The article by Bosch, Albee, and Henderson discusses a similar case
among academic libraries, but with academic or scholarly journals as the focal
point. I'll address some of the citation metrics they discuss.</p>
<h3 id="copyright"><a class="header" href="#copyright">Copyright</a></h3>
<p>Copyright law grants a monopoly to the person or corporate owner of an
intellectual property. That is, the copyright owner has exclusive rights over
the material that they own, where <em>they</em> could be a person or an organizational
entity. Section 106 of the law grants copyright owners the following rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;</p>
<p>(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;</p>
<p>(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;</p>
<p>(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the
copyrighted work publicly;</p>
<p>(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the
individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display
the copyrighted work publicly; and</p>
<p>(6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly
by means of a digital audio transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106">Copyright Section 106</a></p>
<p>These exclusive rights are all encompassing, and intentionally designed to
allow copyright owners a monopoly of their property. In principle and under
some constraints, this is a good thing. However, there are some implications
that we should consider.</p>
<p>In short, if those exclusive rights were followed without limitations, then it
would mean that the exchange of money for a work between a copyright holder and
a buyer for something like a printed book or a DVD would not entail a transfer
of ownership of that physical copy; that is, it would not allow the buyer of
the physical item any distribution rights of the item once the first exchange
has been made. Under such a scenario, libraries would be able to buy physical
books but would not be able to lend them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/">First Sale Doctrine</a> helps avoid the issue granted by the
full-blown list of exclusive rights granted by copyright ownership. Because of
the first sale doctrine, made a precedent in the early 20th century and then
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#109">codified into law in 1976</a>, you, I, or a library may buy a physical
copy of a work, like a book, a DVD, a painting, and literally own that specific
copy. First sale doctrine does not grant us reproduction rights, as they are
listed in Section 106 of the copyright law, but it does allow us to distribute
the singular, physical representation or embodiment of the work that we have
purchased. Thus, this first sale doctrine is why libraries were able to thrive
throughout the 20th century, lend material, and preserve it. More mundanely,
it's also why I can buy a book at a bookstore and later give it away or sell it
to someone after I've finished it.</p>
<p>The digital medium makes things messier, as it tends to do. There are two big
reasons for this. First, digital works are not subject to the same
distributions constraints that physical works are subject to, and the first
sale doctrine is about distribution rights and not reproduction rights. If I
have a physical copy of some book and give you my copy of that book, then I no
longer have that copy. However, if I have a copy of a digital file, then as we
all know, it's relatively trivial for me to share that file with you without
losing access to my own copy. Since digital works can be copied and distributed
without anyone losing access to their copies or even to the original, the First
Sale Doctrine does not apply. In the digital space, there are far fewer
limitations on supply, including on lending.</p>
<p>Second, many digital works are like software, or at least, they are fully
intertwined with the software needed to display them. This is true for all
kinds of documents, like HTML pages, which need a web browser or text editor to
read them and perhaps also other technologies, like JavaScript; or audio files,
which need some a media player to listen to them. But let's consider ebooks as
an example. Ebooks arrive in all shapes and sizes. Project Gutenberg
distributes ebooks that are in the public domain and in various file formats
that include plain text documents that have no presentation markup like bold,
italics, and like, HTML documents with markup, XML documents like EPUB, and
then also PDFs and others. Why so many file formats? Text is text, right, and
in the print space, a book is simply printed on a page, even if it's sometimes
printed on different sized pages or using different type settings. But these
various markups exist because they each offer technological or presentational
advantages and are often tied to specific pieces of software.</p>
<p>This is especially true for proprietary file formats, like the ones that Amazon
created for use only on Kindles, or the popular MP3 file format for audio
recordings that only recently became patent free. While file formats like these
may not be necessarily counted as software, depending on how we define
software, but more like data structures, it is certainly true that file formats
and the specific software applications that display can be completely
intertwined. If you are old enough, you may remember the headaches caused with
files created as <strong>.doc</strong> in some early version of Microsoft Word that later
failed to display properly in a future Microsoft Word version or in some other
word document software. WordPerfect 5.1 was a popular word processing
applications in the 1990s, and it's not clear if files created with that
application, or other popular word processing applications at that time, would
open today, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/%7Eem36/wpdos/wptoword.html">at least without intervention</a>.</p>
<p>In short, these complexities introduce obstacles to the first sale doctrine and
raise other copyright issues because of the connection to software, which is
also often copyrighted. The result is that copyright holders and publishers
have little financial interest in selling actual digital copies of works, since
they cannot prevent future distribution without special technologies, and
instead are more motivated to license material and sometimes explicitly tie
that material to specific pieces of software and hardware, like the Kindle,
which would have to be bought, and that adds additional expense.</p>
<p>What does this mean for libraries in the digital age? It means that libraries
buy less and rent or license more, and renting means that they continually pay
for something for as long as they want access to it. As Sanchez (2015) puts it,
&quot;At its simplest, this takes the form of paying x dollars per year per title
during the length of the contract.&quot; When the total supply of works increases,
e.g., the total number of published books increases, as they do each year, then
it means renting more and more without ever completely acquiring. When budgets
are cut or are stagnant, this ultimately means a decline in the collection a
library has to offer, or if not a decline in the collection, then cuts in some
other areas of a library, like the number of librarians or other staff. This is
the conundrum that Sanchez raises in his article.</p>
<p>If that alone were the issue, maybe librarians could discern other sustainable
ways to proceed, but Sanchez raises additional issues and questions: what if
publishers raise the prices for digital content at an annual rate faster than
what they already raise for print content (reasonable assumption)? If so, does
that mean that librarians will be able to afford fewer titles, digital or
print, unless they raise their budgets, and, as they weed, how would that
impact the physical space of the library? See figure 2.3, specifically, from
Sanchez's article. The plot shows just how much could be lost and how little
gained if the forecasts Sanchez discusses come true.</p>
<p>Keep all of this in mind as you process Sanchez's article. You can even connect
it to some discussions you've already had about accessing digital content.
Specifically, there are many ways to put constraints on the supply of an item
in the digital landscape, as opposed to limiting supply in the physical space,
which include fewer methods. That is, it's relatively easy for publishers and
others to restrict the supply of physical works. They simply have to limit how
many of those physical works are manufactured (e.g., the number of print runs).
But given the nature of digital content, restricting supply is driven by the
technologies available to do so, and since there are so many publishers and
distribution points, then each one of these points will often create their own
unique type of constraint on the supply. The result is that there will be a
number of confusing methods implemented to limit constraint, even if these
limitations are marketed as selling points. In practice, this may mean that
only a limited number of people may &quot;check&quot; out a work from a library at one
time, or access a database at one time, and so forth. Thus, the budget issue
has an impact on access and usability.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the last time I taught this course, I reached out to Joseph Sanchez
and interviewed him. Please enjoy the interview! It's long but it was a very
fun exchange.</p>

<p>Although ebooks likely represent the biggest impact on public library budgets,
academic libraries are largely concerned with scholarly journals. Like Sanchez
(2015), Bosch, Albee, &amp; Henderson (2018) show that the major issue here is that
academic library budgets are declining or holding flat, even though prices
continue to increase for journal titles and though the number of published
articles increase. This raises an interesting phenomenon---that although
researchers are hurt by the lack of access to research, researchers are also
part of the cause of the increase simply because they continue to publish more
and more. Ironically, the result of that rate of increase is less access for
many.</p>
<p>The authors also note that part of the drive to publish includes a drive to
publish in so-called <em>prestigious</em> journal titles, where <em>prestigious</em> is
determined by how well cited the title is. The authors refer to a few
citation-based metrics that the research community uses to determine prestige.
These include the long-established <em>Impact Factor</em>, which can be examined in
the <em>Journal Citation Reports</em> (JCR) provided by Clarivate Analytics, as well
as newer ones, such as the <em>Eigenfactor</em> and the <em>Article Influence Score</em>,
which can also be examined in JCR (the eigenfactor.org site is not well
updated, at the time of this writing).</p>
<p>One motivation for using a citation metric as the basis of evaluating journal
titles is because citation metrics indicate, at some level, the use of the
title. That is, a citation to an article in a journal title means, ideally,
that the authors citing that article have read the article. Historically, when
Eugene Garfield invented the <em>Impact Factor</em>, it was partly so as a tool for
librarians to use in collection management because he recognized this use-based
theory of citations.</p>
<p>However, citation metrics should never be the sole or even primary tool for
such purposes, though. While they may provide good information, there are many
caveats. First, there are different fields of research, and some fields cite at
different rates and at different volumes than other fields, and also for
different reasons. This is why, in Table 5 of the Bosch, Albee, and Henderson
(2018) article, the cost per cite for journals in the Philosophy &amp; Religion
category are so much higher that the cost per cite of titles in other
categories. Authors in P&amp;R simply have different citation and publishing
behaviors than authors in other categories. Second, citations do not capture
all uses of a journal. For example, there are many journal titles that I might
use in my courses but may not use in my research, and this is true for other
faculty, yet citation metrics won't reflect that kind of use. The authors refer
to <em>altmetrics</em>, which was invented to help capture additional non-citing uses
of scholarly products, but altmetrics is still in its infancy and is largely
dependent on data sources and scholarly behavior that are problematic
themselves. Third, there are various issues with the metrics themselves. The
<em>Impact Factor</em> is based on a calculation that is outdated and not a very
appropriate statistical measure. The other calculations were created to address
that but may have other problems. And four, the use of the metrics, regardless
of which one, tends to drive publishing behavior---such that journal titles
with higher metrics tend to attract more submissions and more attention, thus
driving more citations to them. Thus, citation based metrics are comparable to
a kind of capitalist economic system where, as the sociologist of science
Robert Merton noted, <a href="http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthew1.pdf">the richer get richer (in citations) and the poor get
poorer</a>. The issue then is that prestige, defined in this way,
does not necessarily indicate quality---just use.</p>
<p>The authors also discuss some issues with <em>Gold Open Access</em> and the idea that
Gold OA may compound the cost problem. This is where authors pay a publication
fee, or an article processing charge (APC), once a manuscript has been
submitted and accepted by a journal (there are other types of Gold OA cost
models). We can do a quick off the cuff and rough calculation to see why this
might compound the problem. As an example, <em>PLOS ONE</em> is one of the largest
gold OA journals and charges an <a href="https://www.plos.org/publication-fees">APC of $1,695 USD</a> (that's $100 more
than it cost about a year ago). In 2018, 32 papers were published in PLOS ONE
that included at least one author from the University of Kentucky, totaling
$51,040 in APCs for the 50 total institutions that were associated with these
papers. Thus, this amounts to about $1020 per institution, paid for by the
authors and not libraries. For UK authors, this also amounts to over $32,640
spent on APCs (32 * $1020). This is about $27K more than the average price of
the most expensive category, Chemistry, as reported in Table 1 of the reading.
I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>In a follow-up video, I'll demonstrate some tools used to examine the discussed
metrics.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="licensing-basics"><a class="header" href="#licensing-basics">Licensing Basics</a></h1>
<p>This week we start two week's of discussion on licensing. Licensing is at the
top of the list of most important aspects of electronic resource management. We
start our coverage now because it was necessary to learn about the technical
and the economic aspects of ERM work as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>First, we should not that there is a hierarchical difference between <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/">copyright
law</a> and contract law. In short, although copyright is a kind of
<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/">temporary <em>right</em></a> (ante public domain status), unlike other
types of rights (e.g., legal or civil rights), it is a <em>right</em> that can be
transferred or sold by way of a contract. Contract law, thus, supersedes
copyright law.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.esports.law/blog/licensing-agreements-components-and-concerns">licensing agreements</a> offer copyright or
intellectual property owners a contractual framework. This framework functions
as a contractual agreement among two or more parties, and it enables the
parties involved to participate, within some range of time (all contracts must
have starting and ending dates), in an owner's intellectual property under
certain conditions. Librarians enter into licensing agreements of all kinds.
The types of things that are licensed include bibliographic databases, ILS/ERM
software, and of course, e-content. Unfortunately, regarding the latter,
entering a licensing agreement for e-content means that libraries do not own
that content but only have access for a period of time, as defined in the
contract. This is unlike print works, which fall under the first-sale doctrine.
That is, once a library ones, for example, a physical book, it owns it for as
long as they want to or can own it. Basically, the existence of a licensing
agreement between a library and an intellectual property owner entails lack of
ownership of the <em>item</em> (think of item as defined by the <em>Functional
Requirements for Bibliographic Records</em> <a href="https://www.loc.gov/cds/downloads/FRBR.PDF">FRBR</a> model).</p>
<p>The readings are pretty straightforward, but let's preview some basics, which
are nicely outlined in Weir (2016) (not in the reading but referenced below):</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two general types of licensing agreements:
<ul>
<li><strong>End user agreements</strong> are generally the kind that people accept when
they use some kind of software or some service.</li>
<li><strong>Site agreements</strong> are the kinds of agreements librarians get involved
in when they negotiate for things like databases. Here, <em>site</em> refers to
the organizational entity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are several important parts of a standard license. They include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Introductions</strong>: this includes information about the licensee and the
licensor, date information, some information about payments and the
schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong>: this section defines the major terms of the contract.
Weir includes, as examples, the licensee, the licensor, authorized user,
user population, and whether the contract entails a single or multi-user
site.</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong>: This covers topics such as IP authentication and proxy
access.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptable use</strong>: Included here are issues related to downloading,
storage, print rights, interlibrary loan (ILL), and preservation.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited use</strong>: What cannot people do: download restrictions, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: What the licensee's (the library) responsibilities.
Be careful about accepting responsibility for actions that the library
would have a difficult time monitoring. Then also, what are the
licensor's responsibilities. This might include topics such as 24 hour
access.</li>
<li><strong>Term and terminations</strong>: Details about the terms of the contract and
how the contract may be terminated. Be aware that many libraries are
attached to either municipal, county, or state governments and must
adhere to relevant laws.</li>
<li>Various provisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, the California Digital Library, via the University of
California, provides a <a href="https://cdlib.org/resources/vendors/license-agreement-checklist/">checklist</a> and a copy of their standard
license agreement.</p>
<p>The checklist covers four main sections and is well worth a read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content and Access</li>
<li>Licensing</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Management</li>
</ul>
<p>We have three additional readings this week. One of the readings covers SERU: A
Shared Electronic Resource Understanding, by NISO. We also have a short article
by Regan that provides some guidelines on becoming competent on licensing.</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/8593/RP-7-2012_SERU.pdf">SERU</a>, <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/seru">Shared Electronic Resource Understanding</a>, is a NISO
collaborative document that helped standardize some aspects of the licensing
process and can be used as &quot;an alternative to a license agreement&quot; if a
provider and a library agrees to use it. Like the standard licensing structure
that Weir (2016) outlines, SERU includes parts that describe use, inappropriate
use, access, and more but also posits other stipulations, such as
confidentiality and privacy.</p>
<p>The other reading is the <a href="https://www.nasig.org/Core-Competencies">NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources
Librarians</a>. We have already visited this, and although it doesn't
specifically cover licensing, I added it to this week's reading list for a
couple of reasons. First, it's a reminder that when we talk about electronic
resource management, we talk about a comprehensive list of responsibilities,
skills, technologies, and more, and I need to keep this on our radar. Second,
because the Regan reading specifically mentions these competencies, and I
thought it would good to reintroduce them here.</p>
<p>This week, after reading the material, I want you to focus on the Regan article
and some of the questions raised there. Regan raises important questions about
the licensing process, about effective communication, and about advocacy. I
want you to comment on these issues, and I want you to answer some questions
that Regan raises. You can do that by searching the web and library websites.
In fact, at the beginning of the semester I asked you to subscribe to the
SERIALST email list. It's now time to draw upon that and any discussions you've
seen in those lists that are related. You can usually search the archives of
those lists, especially since traffic has been a bit light recently. Regan
mentions some other sources, such as <a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/">LIBLICENSE</a> and
<a href="https://www.copyrightlaws.com/">copyrightlaws.com</a>. Any of these are fair game for our discussions,
but the latter is a commercial entity that provides material and tutorials for
a kind of tuition. It might be useful to know about it, but explore only if you
want. However, LIBLICENSE provides model licenses as well as links to
<a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/licensing-information/model-license/">additional model licences</a>, including the above mentioned
California Digital Library Standard License Agreement. The LIBLICENSE model
license includes even more details, such as types of authorized uses, and
details that include provisions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>course reserves</li>
<li>course packs</li>
<li>electronic links</li>
<li>scholarly sharing</li>
<li>scholarly citation</li>
<li>text and data mining</li>

<p>Since we are watching a long video again and also have a solid number of
readings, I will keep this lecture short.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Abbie Brown, first. In her talk, note that she highlights the
middle ground on:</p>
<ul>
<li>principled negotiation</li>
<li>assertive communicators</li>
</ul>
<p>She also discusses, based on her experience, some stereotypes that get in the
way of negotiating. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Librarian stereotypes: Years ago, I was at a dinner with a friend of mine and
their family when my friend mentioned me going to library school. The father
of my friend then said, &quot;isn't that women's work?&quot; So the existence of this
stereotype is true, and if applicable to you, I hope you do not have to deal
with it. My advice is to stick with Abbie Brown's suggestion to focus on
principled negotiation and assertive communication. And if you're judged
based on other stereotypes, please don't tolerate it.</li>
<li>Library stereotypes: libraries are major players in the economy and have
important economic buying power. Know that you come from a position of power.</li>
<li>Vendors stereotypes: these are just as incorrect. As Brown notes, the people
who work for vendors often have Master's degrees from library science
programs. In fact, I went to library school with people who now work for
vendors, and students in this class have and do work for vendors. These
people are certainly aware of the complexities surrounding libraries and
librarians and the values that librarians uphold. So you often will have a
lot of mutual understanding from the start and should not necessarily have to
assume any baseline antagonism.</li>
<li>In the end, try work against any and all of these stereotypes. I think that
if you do this, then it will reduce a lot of anxiety that we might carry with
us when we go to the negotiating table.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like that also that Abbie Brown stresses the importance of building and
maintaining relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus from the beginning on building and maintaining a good relationship with your vendor. There are benefits to this, as Abbie Brown lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brown's practical suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>talk through things, with colleagues and vendors</li>
<li>write well and succinctly, and put in writing (and be careful what you put in
writing)</li>
<li>I know that some of you have already had hesitations about the licensing
agreements we've discussed already. Brown covers this in some detail and in
real world ways and discusses how, e.g., SERU, is not always used but is
still helpful to have out there as a point of reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to Brown's talk, we also read a few articles. The Smith and
Hartnett article provides a nice real world example of the negotiating process
that includes a work flow around licensing (again, the workflow!). Remember,
document everything and revisit your documentation. That's how formalized
checklists come into being and why they're useful. Having a workflow in place
around licensing will help make your work more efficient and help ensure that
all bases are covered.</p>
<p>The Dygert and Barrett article covers the specifics of licensing---what to look
for, what shouldn't be given away, how to negotiate principally, and more.
Likewise, the Dunie article gets into the specifics of the negotiation process
and includes definitions of terms, business models, and strategies.</p>
<p>This week will not necessarily prepare us to become negotiators. The main point
I want to make this week is this: if you find yourself in a position where one
of your job responsibilities is to negotiate with vendors for e-resources (or
for anything else), then come back to these sources of information and spend
additional time studying them and taking notes on them. Sources like these, and
others like them in the literature, will prepare you if you study them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="acquisitions-and-collections-development"><a class="header" href="#acquisitions-and-collections-development">Acquisitions and Collections Development</a></h1>
<p>Note:
Add resources:
https://openstax.org/subjects</p>
<p>Class, this week we discuss aspects of collection development and acquisitions,
which is a complex problem for electronic resources. To rehash, in the
print-only days, acquiring resources was a <em>more-than-it-is-now</em> linear
process. Librarians became aware of an item, sought reviews of the item,
possibly collected the item, described it, and then shelved it. And maybe,
depending on the type of the library, weeded it from the collection at some
point in the years to come during their regular course of collection
assessment.</p>
<p>There are additional vectors to be aware of with electronic resources. First,
libraries may or may not necessarily own digital works, but different
subscription services require different kinds of contracts, as we have learned.
Second, electronic resources (ebooks, journal articles, databases, etc.)
require different handling and disseminating processes due to technological and
licensing barriers. Martin et al. (2009) truly nail the issue in their article
where they write that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as we would like to think our primary concerns about collecting are
based on content, not format, e-resources have certainly challenged many
long-established notions of how we buy, collect, preserve, and provide access
to information (p. 217).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although a world where the format dictates so much makes an intriguing world,
it can be problematic and worrisome. We think that content should be king, but
we must ask, how does format either prevent or facilitate access? If you catch
the implicit gotcha there, you can see that we're building a thread between
acquisitions, collections development, and usability, which we'll learn more
about latter in the semester.</p>
<p>One thing about this week: in a collection development course, you would
unquestionably focus on content and on the work that is involved creating a
collection development policy (which I hope you do or spearhead if your library
does not have one). I'll briefly discuss this soon. Those things are relevant
to the acquisition and collection of e-resources. However, in a major way, one
of the things you should take away from this week's reading is how much the
management of electronic resources have impacted librarian work flows and how
that has shaped, or reshaped, library organizational hierarchy. I'll provide an
organizational chart for you to discuss, and we'll use it to discuss how
electronic resources have shaped the organizational structure of the library.</p>
<p>The Lamothe (2015) article is good in a different way. Lamothe finds that if
electronic e-reference sources are collected and perpetually updated, then they
get continually used. If it's a static e-resource (compare, e.g., to a resource
pushed out in PDF, although it could be in HTML), then usage declines. I hope
additional studies pursue this line of questioning because it raises questions
about the expectations that our patrons have about our content; perhaps
something about how <em>fresh</em> they expect that content should be, where such an
expectation may have existed in different shape in prior years. It also
suggests that a resource like Wikipedia has an advantage, since much of
Wikipedia is regularly updated, or the site in general appears broadly so since
many parts of it are continually updated.</p>
<p>The Open Educational Resources (OER) issue is a hot topic these days. Textbook
prices, as the article by England et al. (2017) notes, have skyrocketed in
recent decades. Some textbooks cost hundreds of dollars, and the problem
impacts both school and academic libraries. UK Libraries has a helpful page
about Open Educational Resources. I'll provide a link here in the transcript
and in the discussion prompt, and that page links to OER content for both types
of libraries, including <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/">oercommons.org</a>. Explore this information, and
discuss whether libraries ought to collect and acquire these resources  or
(e.g., by adding records to them in their online public access catalogs or
discovery systems), or should they not be involved at all? This seems like a
<em>duh</em> kind of question, but libraries, public or academic, have not
traditionally collected textbooks. Does this change the game for them as
educational institutions?</p>
<p>A quick note about the organizational charts. The chart that I created was
based on my readings of librarian departmental reports written during the late
1950s and early 1960s by librarians at UK. These reports are held at the
University of Kentucky's <a href="http://libraries.uky.edu/SC">Special Collections Research Center</a>, which
is fortunately in the building next to mine on campus. Organizational charts
have been around since the 1800s, but I am not sure when libraries started to
create and use them, and I didn't see one in my research on the history of UK
Libraries for this time period. Thus, I inferred the organizational structure
based on the detailed reports written by the various department heads in the
library at the time. When you compare my chart based on the past to the current
one provided by UK Libraries, I think you will be intrigued by how much more
complicated the current chart is today.</p>
<p>This complexity is very interesting. The growth in electronic resources,
associated technologies, and markets do not explain all of it: knowledge has
become more specialized, and library organizational structure will reflect
that; the student population has grown considerably since then, in size and
heterogeneity, and library structure will reflect that; and the theory and
praxis of library management has evolved throughout the decades, and library
structure will reflect that. Other issues are at play, and it is certainly true
that they are all interconnected, but I do think that technology and
e-resources accounts for a large portion of what we see here, and I'm looking
forward to reading what you have to say about this.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd be guilty of a serious wrongdoing if I did not discuss the
importance of having a collection development policy (CDP) and using that
policy to guide the collection, acquisition, and assessment of electronic
resources. I don't mean to overlap any discussions you may have had about this
if you've had a collection management course, I only want to emphasize the
importance of a CDP for e-resources. Unfortunately, not all libraries, even at
major institutions, create or use a CDP, and if you end up working at one, then
I'd highly encourage you to convince your colleagues of its importance. A CDP
should define a collection, and then include most if not all the following
topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>mission, vision, and values statement</li>
<li>purpose of CDP statement (scope may be included here)</li>
<li>selection criteria: this could be general but it could also include
subsections that focus on specific populations, genres, resource types, and
more</li>
<li>assessment and maintenance criteria</li>
<li>challenged materials criteria (esp important at public, K-12 libraries)</li>
<li>weeding and/or replacement criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Included in this transcript are links to two CDP policies, one from the
<a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/collections/policies/electronic-resources">University of Maryland</a> and one from the <a href="https://www.lexpublib.org/collection-development-policy">Lexington Public
Library</a>. The Maryland CDP is not their main one but is a sub-CDP
that focuses on electronic resources. The LPL policy is the main one for them,
and although it does not include a long discussion of electronic resources,
they are mentioned in the policy. Neither approach is wrong but are catered to
the specific libraries and their purposes, communities, and vision statements.
This week, I would like you to search on the web for more and to read through
ones you find for how they discuss electronic resources.</p>

<p>Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018) write that &quot;user experience determines the
quality of an interaction being used by an actor in order to achieve a specific
outcome.&quot; Parush (2017) highlights relevant terms like <em>human-computer
interaction (HCI)</em> and <em>usability</em>. Let's say then that HCI encompasses the
entire domain of interaction between people and computers and how that
interaction is designed, whereas <em>user experience (UX)</em> focuses on the quality
of that interaction or an interaction with something (like a product). These
are not precise definitions, and some might use the terms <em>UX</em> and <em>HCI</em>
interchangeably. As ERM librarians, though, it is our job to focus on the
quality of the patron's experience with our electronic services, and this
entails understanding both the systems and technologies involved and the users
interacting with these systems and technologies.</p>
<p>Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018) outline the parameters that are involved with UX.
Let me modify their example and frame it within the context of an ERM
experience for a patron:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actor</strong>: a user of the web resource, like a library website</li>
<li><strong>Object</strong>: the web resource, or some part of it</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: the setting. What's happening? What's the motivation for use?
What's the background knowledge? What's the action?</li>
<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: the tools made available by the object as well as the
look and feel. More specifically, Parush (2017) states that &quot;the user
interface mediates between the user and computer&quot; and it includes three basic
components:
<ul>
<li><em>controls</em>: the tools used to control and interact with the system:
buttons, menus, voice commands, keyboards, etc</li>
<li><em>displays</em>: the information presented to the user or the hardware used to
present the information: screens, speakers, etc.</li>
<li><em>interactions and dialogues</em>: the exchange between the system and the
user including the use of the controls and responding to feedback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interaction</strong>: what the actor is doing with the UI</li>
<li><strong>(Intended/Expected/Prior) User experience</strong>: the intended or expected use
of the object. The user's expectations based on prior use.</li>
<li><strong>(Actual) User experience</strong>: the actions that took place; the actions that
had to be modified based on unintended results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters would be helpful for devising a UX study that involves
observing patrons interacting with a system and then interviewing them to
complete the details. Note that the same kind of systematic thinking can be
applied to evaluate other user experiences, like those between a librarian and
an electronic resource management system. Often the focus is on patron user
experience, but it's just as important to evaluate UX for librarians and to
consider UX when selecting an ERM system or an ILS system.</p>
<p>In any case, these parameters help us step through and highlight the
complicated process of interacting with a computer, generally, or a library
resource, more specifically. As with many other topics we've discussed this
semester, we can also incorporate these parameters into a workflow for
evaluating UX. But, it is because of the complexities involved and a focus on
the systems that Pennington (2015) argues for a more UX centered approach to
library website design. To emphasize their case, think about your own state of
knowledge of ERM before you started to take this course. For example, a number
of you have explored in depth how link resolvers function, and your experience
using them as patrons and your understanding of their technical aspects as
librarians have provided you with a set of skills and experiences that make you
more likely to identify the cause of a malfunction if you find one. But with
the ability to suss out an issue, it becomes easier to solve, and the
experience itself involves less anxiety. Most users and patrons of these
systems will not have any technical knowledge of these systems, and when they
break for them, their frustration with the <strong>experience</strong> might lead to
unfortunate outcomes. For example, they may not retrieve the information they
need; they may not reach out to a librarian; they might stop using the
library's resources in preference for something of inferior quality; and so
forth. We need to not forget that this happens, and if possible, to likewise
design for such failures of a system (because they will fail). How might we,
for instance, design an action to occur when a link resolver or a proxy server
fails to identify and retrieve a work?</p>
<p>Here's the crux. As you gain more skill and expertise with these systems, you
will eventually lose the ability to see these systems as a novice user, and
that distance will only grow over time. It is therefore, as Pennington (2015)
argues, important to gather data from users. User experience research nurtures
a user centered mindset.</p>
<p>The second article by Pennington, Chapman, Fry, Deschenes, and McDonald (2016)
is a contribution from four librarians with theoretical and practical
suggestions for UX research. Both Pennington and Chapman note the best way to
measure UX or detect UX issues is to conduct research with users (recall our
conversations on proactive troubleshooting), but this isn't always possible due
to financial, time, or other constraints. However, there is a wealth of
research on UX and in the absence of the ability to conduct research, locating
prior research and applying that research to your setting is paramount. Drawing
from the literature, Chapman describes several important UX principles that
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>chunking</li>
<li>highlighting and prominence</li>
<li>KISS</li>
<li>choice simplification</li>
<li>choice reduction</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to user studies and prior research, libraries possess a wealth of
data to explore and this data could provide a lot of insight. The same caveat
applies that Chapman described: if only you have time to analyze the data. But
Fry points out that you can access library data about location of user, device
type, resource use, and more. (There are some privacy issues involved with
this, and we'll talk about them at the end of the semester.) Furthermore,
here's where the Browning (2015) article is helpful. Whereas Fry describes what
we can learn from data about usage, Browning describes what we can learn from
data about breakage. Both kinds of data can offer us a substantial
understanding about user experience.</p>
<p>If you can conduct a user study, then Deschenes offers helpful tips on
recruiting users. Remember that the users that you recruit should be actual
users of the systems. If you are interested in why some segments of the
population do not use the library's resources, then that would be a different
kind of study.</p>
<p>I agree with McDonald that despite having around 30 or so years of experience
with web-based electronic resources, more with other types of electronic
resources that existed prior to the web and that were based on the then
internet, on optical disks, etc., we are still in the throes of disruption.
There's a lot yet to learn about design for the web, just like there's a lot of
left to learn about how to design a home or office, and nothing will be settled
for a while. Although I doubt if there will be any single dominate user
experience or user interface, since there are many cultures and backgrounds and
experiences, I'm fairly sure the low-hanging fruit problems will work out
eventually. Remember though that 95% of the cause of all of this is due to
copyright issues, which necessitate the entire electronic resource ecosystem
and the complications that are introduced by having to work with vendors who
work with different, but overlapping, publishers, etc. If something were to
change about copyright, then it's a whole new ballgame.</p>
<p>On a final note, you might be wondering how <em>information seeking</em> is related to
<em>HCI</em> and to <em>UX</em>. Anytime we interact with a computer (broadly speaking) in
order to seek information, then we have an overlap. But there are areas of
non-overlap, too. We don't always use computers to look for information, and we
don't always look for information on computers. <em>UX</em> is like this, too. <em>UX</em> is
not always about computers but can be about user experience generally. I bring
this up because if you do become involved with <em>UX</em> work at a library (or
elsewhere), then I'd encourage you to refer also to the information seeking and
related literature when it's appropriate to do so. Remember, it's all
interconnected.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="evaluation-and-statistics"><a class="header" href="#evaluation-and-statistics">Evaluation and Statistics</a></h1>
<p>We've discussed problems this semester with defining terms, and we have learned
that a lot of effort has been expended into standardizing them. We have also
seen that the topics that we've covered---technologies, standards, access,
usability, workflow, markets, licensing---are linked in some way. All this
complexity makes the measurement of <em>usage</em> that much more complicated. The
problem is that when electronic resources (or basically all activity on the web
and internet) are accessed, a computer server somewhere keeps a log of that
interaction. Having logs available makes it seem that we can have accurate data
about usage, but it's not a guarantee, and the insight we may be able to glean
is always difficult to acquire no matter how much data is available to us.</p>
<p>Example web server access log entry (I've obfuscated the IP address and the
website domain):</p>
<pre><code>99.999.99.99 - - [21/Oct/2021:10:54:35 -0400] &quot;GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1&quot; 404 517 &quot;https://WEBSITE.edu/&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/93.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Access log type data can be good data to explore, but we have to be mindful
that all data has limitations, and that there are different ways to define what
usage means. For example, the log snippet above indicates that I visited that
link at that server, but does that mean that I really <strong>used</strong> that website
even though I accessed it? Even if we can claim that I did, what kind of use
was it? Can we tell? (We can actually learn quite a lot from web server access
logs.)</p>
<p>This week we learn about the efforts that have gone into standardizing usage
metrics and usage reports via Project Counter. Also, we see a few examples of
how usage data can help inform collection development and benefit the library
in other ways. This is an important area of electronic resource librarianship,
but it's also an area that may overlap with other parts of librarianship, such
as systems librarianship or collection development. Here we might see job
titles like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=library+systems+administrator">library systems administrator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="project-counter"><a class="header" href="#project-counter">Project Counter</a></h2>
<p>Project Counter is a Code of Practice that seeks to help provide more
informative and consistent reporting of electronic resource usage. From
<a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/introduction-to-counter-code-of-practice-release-5/">Project Counter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its inception in 2002, COUNTER has been focused on providing a code of
practice that helps ensure librarians have access to consistent, comparable,
and credible usage reporting for their online scholarly information. COUNTER
serves librarians, content providers, and others by facilitating the
recording and exchange of online usage statistics. The COUNTER Code of
Practice provides guidance on data elements to be measured and definitions of
these data elements, as well as guidelines for output report content and
formatting and requirements for data processing and auditing. To have their
usage statistics and reports designated COUNTER compliant, content providers
MUST provide usage statistics that conform to the current Code of Practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, these reports were designed to help solve a problem that will likely
never completely be solved, but it's still an important and useful effort. The
main goal of Counter is to provide usage reports, and the reports, for version
5 of Counter, cover four major areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Titles</li>
<li>Items</li>
</ul>
<p>And you can see which reports these four replace in <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/2448-2/">a table in Appendix B of
the Code of Practice</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/foreword/">Counter 5</a> was designed to include better reporting consistency,
better clarity of metrics that measure usage activity, better views of the
data, and more. In order to clarify the purpose of Counter, let's review the
introduction to the <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/introduction-to-counter-code-of-practice-release-5/">Code of Practice</a>, which articulates the
purpose, scope, application, and more of Counter.</p>
<p>[ Note: Review the Introduction to the Code of Practice ]</p>
<h2 id="readings-3"><a class="header" href="#readings-3">Readings</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2017.1391153">Pesch (2017)</a> provides a helpful introduction to the history of
Project Counter and the migration from Counter version 4 to version 5. Table 1
in Pesch describes the four major reports. Most of the reports are
self-explanatory. Database, Title, and Item reports cover what they describe,
but Platform reports might be less obvious. These reports include usage metrics
at the broadest level and of things like EBSCOhost databases, ProQuest
databases, SAGE resources, Web of Science databases, and so on. These reports
come into play when users/patrons search in the overall platform but not in any
single database provided by the platform. For example, UK Libraries subscribes
to the ProQuest Databases and for us, that includes <a href="https://www.proquest.com/databases/advanced?accountid=11836">35 primary
databases</a>. Users can search many at the same time or search any single
one. The same holds for platforms like EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and others.
This is the platform level.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2016.1165783">Scott (2016)</a> article provides a nice use case for how Counter
reports can inform collection development. We've talked a bit about the <em>Big
Deal</em> packages that more libraries are trying to move away from because such
deals often include access to titles that are not used or not relevant to a
library community. Here Scott shows that it might be possible to avoid
subscribing to some services using this data, but it's also important to
closely read through and understand the problems associated with interlibrary
loan, the metrics, and other limitations described in the Conclusion section of
this article.</p>
<p>We move away from Project Counter with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5860/crl12-406">Stone and Ramsden
(2013)</a> article. I wanted to introduce this article because it
highlights how metrics can be used to assess the value of a library, which is
often underestimated by administration but constantly required in order to
garner the resources needed to improve or sustain a library's resources. Here
Stone and Ramsden investigate the correlation (not causation) between library
usage and student retention. Increasing the latter is the Holy Grail of college
and universities. If this were a public library report, it might be interesting
to see how well electronic library usage correlates to continued usage and how
such a correlation might result in various outcomes defined by the library. One
nice thing about the Stone and Ramsden article is that it does not depend on
quantitative metrics alone but supports its findings through qualitative
research. There's only so much a usage metric can say.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like you to be aware of the <a href="https://code4lib.org/"><em>code{4}lib</em> journal</a>
and this article by <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10589">Zou</a> is pretty cool. Although this article overlaps
with some security issues, a topic that we'll cover in our last week of the
semester, the article also provides a way of thinking outside the box about the
metrics that you'll have access to as an electronic resource librarian. Here,
Zou describes a process of taking EZproxy logs (compare the example entry with
the web server entry I included above) and turning them into something useful
and dynamic by incorporating some additional technologies. Recall that
<a href="https://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html">EZproxy</a> is software that authenticates users and provides access
given that authentication. We use EZproxy at UK whenever we access a paywalled
journal article. That is, you've noticed the <strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong> string in any
URL for a journal that you've accessed via UK Libraries' installation of
EZproxy, and the URL <code>https://login.ezproxy.uky.edu/login</code> is the log in URL.
Zou specifically references <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210716020704/https://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/post/analyzing-ezproxy-logs/">the standard way</a> of analyzing these logs
(take a look at the page at that link), which can be insightful and helpful,
but Zou's method makes the analysis of these logs more visual and real-time.
The main weakness with Zou's method is that it seems to me to be highly
dependent on Zou doing the work. If Zou leaves their library, then this
customized analysis might not last. Still, it's good to know that if you have
an interest in developing skills with systems administration, with various
other technologies, and with some basic scripting language, this kind of thing,
and more, is possible.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="privacy-and-security"><a class="header" href="#privacy-and-security">Privacy and Security</a></h1>
<p>Breeding starts off with <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/5973/7606">Chapter 1</a> from <a href="https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/issue/view/549">this week's
reading</a> of <a href="https://journals.ala.org/">Library Technology Reports</a> with the following
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Libraries have a long tradition of taking extraordinary measures to ensure the privacy of those who use their facilities and access their materials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is mostly true but not entirely so. When I was an undergraduate, I
remember going to the library to look for books on a sensitive topic. I saw a
book on the shelves that looked relevant, and when I pulled it off the shelf
and opened it, I noticed that a friend of mine had checked the book out before
me because their name was written on the due date card in their handwriting.
Even though I had grown up with these due date cards in library books, it had
never occurred to me before then how these cards could pose a problem with
privacy. At the time, I decided not to check out that book because of that
issue.</p>
<p>We might be comforted in thinking that the kind of information that was
supposedly revealed to me in the book that my friend had checked out, and that
I had opened, is the kind of information that would not scale up easily. It was
a serendipitous event that involved me looking for a book on the same topic and
then just happening to pick the one book that my friend had used. It's not
likely, then, that this might pose a big problem at scale.</p>
<p>However, let's think of that information in that due date card as metadata, and
then ask, how could we use it? The sociologist Kieren Healy did that kind of
thing with membership lists from colonial times. He showed that using limited
data like the one I found in that book, some important things could be
discovered. For example, <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/">Healy</a> imagined that if the British had
access to simple social network analysis tools back in 1772, they could have
identified that Paul Revere was a patriot and then have used that information
to prevent or interfere with the American Revolution. I encourage you to read
his blog entry and his <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/11/following-up-on-paul-revere/">follow-up reflection</a> because it is a neat
<em>what-if</em> hypothetical case study.</p>
<p>Most libraries in North America have replaced due date slips with bar codes,
and while this has removed the problem above, the overall migration from
paper-based workflows to electronic ones have raised other problems. Not long
after the Patriot Act was passed after 9/11, FBI agents ordered a Connecticut
librarian to <a href="https://www.courant.com/opinion/op-ed/hc-op-librarians-stand-up-to-patriot-act-again-20160927-story.html">&quot;identify patrons who had used library computers online at a
specific time one year earlier&quot;</a>. Per the law, the librarians
involved were placed under a gag order, which prevented them from speaking out.
This led to a lawsuit against the then US Attorney General. Eventually the
librarians were released from their gag order and allowed to discuss the event.</p>
<p>There are occasionally big, dramatic cases like the one described above, but
privacy and security issues are often much more mundane but still quite
important. Since many users of libraries of all types visit library homepages,
then encrypting all the web/internet traffic is important. A year and a half
ago, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/browsers-to-block-access-to-https-sites-using-tls-1-0-and-1-1-starting-this-month/">major web browsers announced</a> that they would no longer
support Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol versions 1.1 or earlier, and
that any site that had not yet migrated to TLS version 1.2 or above will not be
accessible. TLS is used to encrypt web traffic. This news came out in early
March 2020, and the browsers postponed blocking these sites because of the
pandemic. But the migration went into affect a few months later, and as you can
see in the screenshot below, for a while I had to enable an insecure connection
to libraries.uky.edu in Firefox if I wanted to visit it. When I enabled it,
then my activity on libraries.uky.edu was potentially visible to others under
certain conditions. Note, however, that once I sign into my library account,
I'm transferred to Primo's cloud service, and then to UK's OAuth page to log
in. These parts of the encryption chain are fairly strong. So it's only
activity specifically on libraries.uky.edu that was not good at the time.</p>
<p><img src="uklibrariesTLSversion.png" alt="UK Libraries TLS Version Block in Firefox" /></p>
<p>In Chapter 1 of this week's reading, Breeding does a nice job introducing a
variety of technologies and policies that are related to security and privacy.
There are important technological things to consider, like web traffic
encryption. There are also important policy considerations, too, like how third
party vendors implement privacy and security mechanisms (like the Primo example
above). Note that the <a href="https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-7-2012-seru">SERU</a> recommended practice has a section
dedicated to Confidentiality and Privacy. In case you work at a library that
does not use SERU, this is how SERU can be useful to you. It can inform us of
the kinds of provisions that a library ought to have in a license if the
default provisions a vendor proposes do not include the necessary components.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Breeding reports on the state of privacy and security protections
among a selection of ERM vendors. I should note that although this article is
only four years old, this area moves fast and it's likely that the problems
that Breeding identifies with some implementations have been fixed in recent
years. As I noted, since browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari have
grown stricter about enforcing encryption, web services have complied by
adhering to better security standards. Chapter 3 covers the same issue from the
library's perspectives. Here is where improvements are much less likely to be
seen. For example, a number of library sites use Google Analytics to track site
usage and other metrics, but this means that our actions, albeit somewhat
anonymized, on these library sites are being collected and stored by Google (or
some other analytic service). Also, many websites, library websites included,
use fonts that are hosted on other servers, but doing so means that these can
be tracked, too (see my the access log entry above as a basic example). There's
a trade-off, though. If we want to learn more about how users interact with the
site in order to improve usability and accessibility, then we have to have some
of this data. Here's where a privacy policy might come into play.</p>
<p>Thus, I point to a <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15340">controversial article</a> that was published on
the <em>code4lib</em> journal last year. I'd highly encourage you to peruse the
article as well as <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15340#comment-2744977">the comments at the bottom of the page</a>:</p>
