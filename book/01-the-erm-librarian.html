<a class="header" href="./01-the-erm-librarian.html#introduction" id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>In this week's lecture, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide examples of electronic resources,</li>
<li>frame the topic of this course, and</li>
<li>discuss the readings.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="./01-the-erm-librarian.html#examples" id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2></a>
<p>This semester we're learning about electronic resources
and about how to manage them.
We begin first by outlining the kinds of things
that are electronic resources.
<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/940697515">Karin Wikoff</a> (2011) outlines the major categories,
and these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>databases
<ul>
<li>A&amp;I databases (abstracting and indexing) / bibliographic databases full
text databases</li>
<li>journal collections, like Project Muse or JSTOR</li>
<li>specialized and hybrid databases, like chemical databases, genetic
databases, stock and business databases</li>
<li>primary source databases, like original newspaper databases, oral
histories, and like</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e-journals
<ul>
<li>open access or proprietary, and the issues associated with these types</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>e-books
<ul>
<li>one note about e-books---here the technology is rather complex and
differentiated depending on the copyright status, the file type (PDF,
ePUB, TXT, etc.), the purpose or genre (textbook, fiction or non-fiction,
etc.). In many cases, e-books are software applications and not just
plain or marked up text, and they also vary by platform or the
application interacting with the text, which offer different types of
functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>linking technologies, e.g., where metadata is embedded in a URL and is sent
across networks, these include:
<ul>
<li>Z39.50</li>
<li>OpenURL</li>
<li>Federated search</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The promise of linking technologies is that it allows an authenticated user to
start off in one system, like an OPAC, and expand a query to other systems
without going out and initiating searches in those other systems. This is
unlike, and more complicated, than our experience on the open web, where we
might start off on one system, like Google, and then migrate to another system,
like Google Scholar, simply by clicking on links. For example, a user starts
off at WorldCat.org and finds a book that's available at a nearby library. The
user only needs to click on the local library link and be transferred to that
library's OPAC. If that works (it doesn't always), then the user may submit a
request to pick up the book, and that involves additional actions, including
logging into the user's library.</p>
<a class="header" href="./01-the-erm-librarian.html#framing" id="framing"><h2>Framing</h2></a>
<p>As you surmise from the above list, electronic resources are a major part of
any library, whether academic, public, school, or special. And that reminds me:
if you are enrolled in the ICT program, you may find that the course will help
you understand how libraries work and help you be a better user of information
and of a library's resources. There are also some parts of the course, like
negotiation and usability, that you may find relevant; however, do note that
this course is focused on librarianship.</p>
<p>The need to manage electronic resources and incorporate them into a library
work flow is of utter importance. This will be much of what we'll discuss and
learn about this semester. And it will be complicated. The print only era of
libraries was difficult enough for many reasons, but managing print and using
print resources was comparably a more linear process. Electronic resources have
raised the ante. And that is to be expected: just think, civilizations have had
500 years to develop and solve print technology, yet we've had only about four
or five decades of experience with digital technology. We're a long way off
from settling on anything stable and we still face challenges and frustrations
that are not simply technical in nature.</p>
<a class="header" href="./01-the-erm-librarian.html#our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship" id="our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship"><h2>Our Readings: The nature of ERM librarianship</h2></a>
<p>Our readings this week provide nice introductions to electronic resource
librarianship and help frame this entire course. The first article by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07317131.2017.1385286">Stachokas</a> surveys part of the history of this specialist
librarian role and then reports on a study of the work the electronic resource
librarian performs today and where she or he is likely to work in the library.
We'll discuss this in our forum.</p>
<p>In the second article, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2016.1164555">Hulseberg</a> uses the field of technical
communication (TC) to interpret the field of electronic resource librarianship.
Hulseberg takes the view that an electronic resource librarian is, perhaps
among other things, a technical communicator. This is much different from being
someone who simply helps patrons with their technical problems. Rather, this is
someone who completes advanced work in documenting and reporting technical
processes.</p>
<p>Hulseberg highlights four important themes about ERM: an interesting theme to
me is <em>Theme Two: Collaborating in a</em> <strong>web of relationships</strong>. When I was an
undergraduate, I imagined the job that I wanted would be one involving
connecting people in different silos to each other and helping them
communicate, which is often harder than it sounds. It turns out electronic
resource librarianship is about this work. However, the other themes are just
as important, and in particular, theme four, about jurisdiction, highlights one
of the major disruptive acts on librarianship in the last thirty or forty
years.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, that most people, researchers and scholars included, use
non-library provided resources to locate information. Additionally, more works,
scholarly and non-scholarly, are freely and publicly available as open access
or like. Jointly, this means, perhaps, that the library, academic, public, and
more, is hypothetically becoming dis-intermediated as a result of people using
sites like Google Scholar to retrieve works freely available on the web. As a
result, what becomes of the core jurisdiction of the librarian? And of the
electronic resource librarian, in particular? In concrete terms: a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-03-2018-0047">recent
paper</a> reported that researchers in their survey stated they use
Google Scholar 83% of the time and EBSCOhost 29% of the time to find relevant
material. That raises questions, strategic and technical ones, about the role
of the librarian and library.</p>
<p>The third article, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2016.02.002">Zhu</a>, places an entirely different theoretical
lens on what it means to be an electronic resource librarian. Here Zhu posits
that the licensing aspect of electronic resource management has had a major
influence on ER librarianship identity. We spend some time this semester
discussing licensing because it informs a fundamental aspect of the work of
electronic resource management. One reason why Zhu's findings are insightful is
because of the nature of electronic resources and the problems with copyright
law, which is brutish in dealing with digital works. Copyright law,
historically, has provided librarians with their most important legal
justification for collecting works (see <a href="https://search.copyright.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=copyright&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=%22first+sale+doctrine%22">First Sale
Doctrion</a>), and while no one could prove a counterfactual like
this, it could be that if the internet and the web had been created before the
modern library, then libraries might not exist, because such a legal
justification would not have existed. However, libraries exist and the
introduction of digital and electronic resources has resulted in substantial
disruptions, organizational changes, and other issues. I'll ask you to discuss
the details of Zhu's article on the boards.</p>
<p>Stachokas, Hulseberg, and Zhu present the historical and environmental forces
that have shaped these views of this work and these identities, and they each
discuss important themes that function as evidence of these identities. In your
discussions this week, focus on these themes and how you make sense of it all.
In conclusion, this semester we'll be exposed to a number of new technologies
that an electronic resource librarian deals with and also the implications of
those technologies on the social aspects of our work. These aspects include our
work flows, our organizational structures, our measurement activities, design
and usability, security, access, licensing and negotiating.</p>
<a class="header" href="./01-the-erm-librarian.html#discussion-questions" id="discussion-questions"><h2>Discussion Questions</h2></a>
<p>As we start to address all of this, I want us to consider two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we manage all of this electronic stuff? Not only does it include
complicated technology and has an impact on our patrons, but it involves of
different sorts of librarians.</li>
<li>What exactly is an electronic resource librarian? I like this basic question
because, due to perhaps representations in the media (movies, TV shows,
books) and the interactions we've had with librarians in our lifetimes, we
all have pretty well-defined, whether accurate, images of what reference or
cataloging librarians are. But what about an electronic resource librarian?
This is something different, right? And it's not likely to be a position
that's ever really captured and presented publicly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep this these questions in consideration when you read the material this
week.</p>
<p>See you on the boards.</p>
