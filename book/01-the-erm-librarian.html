<p>This semester we're learning about electronic resources
and about how to manage them.
Let's begin by outlining the kinds of things
that are electronic resources.
<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/940697515">Karin Wikoff</a> (2011) outlines the major categories,

<blockquote>
<p>Ebook technology is rather complicated and
differentiated depending on the copyright status,
the file type (PDF, ePUB, TXT, etc.), and
the purpose or genre
(textbook, fiction or non-fiction, etc.).
In some cases, ebooks are software applications and
not just plain or marked up text.
They also vary by platform or
the application used to interact with the text,
each of which may offer different types of functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linking technologies allow users
to begin in one search system,
like a discovery service,
which extends that query to other systems
without requiring the user to
initiate searches in those other systems.
For example,
a user begins a search in a library's discovery system,
like UK Library's <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY%3AUKY&amp;lang=en">InfoKat</a>
(powered by Primo (<a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/11856/">Breeding, 2006</a>)).
InfoKat identifies multiple articles there
related to the query,
even though those articles are all located in other
full text systems, like EBSCOHost, ProQuest, or JSTOR.</p>
<h2 id="framing"><a class="header" href="#framing">Framing</a></h2>
<p>The print only era of libraries
was difficult enough for many reasons, but
managing print and using print resources
was comparably a more linear process.
Electronic resources have raised the stakes.
That might be expected:
civilizations have had 500 years
to develop and solve print technology,
yet we have had only about three plus decades of
experience with digital technology.
We are a long way off from stability, and
many of the challenges and frustrations
ahead of us are not simply technical but
also social and legal.</p>
<p>As you may surmise from the outline at the top of this page,
electronic resources are a major part of any library,
whether academic, public, school, or special.
The need to manage them with
efficient work flows requires
attending to many parts of a big system.
This will be much of what we will discuss and
learn about, especially because
there is a lot of complexity in these systems and
these systems have had a major impact on librarianship itself.</p>
<h2 id="our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship"><a class="header" href="#our-readings-the-nature-of-erm-librarianship">Our Readings: The nature of ERM librarianship</a></h2>
<p>Our readings this week provide
introductions to electronic resource librarianship
and help frame this course.</p>
<h3 id="a-specialist-and-a-generalist"><a class="header" href="#a-specialist-and-a-generalist">A Specialist and A Generalist</a></h3>
<p>The first article by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07317131.2017.1385286">Stachokas</a> (2018)
surveys the history of this specialist/generalist librarian role.
Stachokas (2018) finds that
the electronic resource librarian has their feet
planted in technical services and collection development,
that this requires a holistic understanding of the 
electronic resource work flow,
of its embeddedness in the scholarly and library ecosystem, and
that this division is leading to different areas of specialization:
those who focus on
&quot;licensing, acquisitions, and collection development&quot; (p. 15),
and those who focus on
&quot;metadata, discovery, management of 
<a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/kbart/kbart-frequently-asked-questions">knowledge bases</a>, and
addressing technical problems&quot; (p. 15).
This rings true to me.
In my own observations,
I've noticed that job announcements have increasingly stressed
one of the above areas and not both.</p>
<h3 id="the-technical-communicator-as-the-bridge"><a class="header" href="#the-technical-communicator-as-the-bridge">The Technical Communicator as the &quot;Bridge&quot;</a></h3>
<p>In the second article,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1941126X.2016.1164555">Hulseberg</a> (2016) uses
the field of <a href="https://www.stc.org/about-stc/defining-technical-communication/">technical communication (TC)</a>
to interpret the field of electronic resource librarianship.
Hulseberg (2016) takes the view that an
electronic resource librarian is, among other things,
a technical communicator.
This is much different from being
someone who helps patrons with their technical problems.
Rather, this is someone who completes advanced work in
documenting and reporting technical processes.</p>
<p>Hulseberg (2016) highlights four important themes about ERM:
the interesting themes to me are
<em>Theme one: Metaphors of &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;translator&quot;</em>, and
<em>Theme Two: Collaborating in a web of relationships</em>.
When I was an undergraduate,
I imagined the job that I wanted
would be one involving connecting people in different silos
to each other by helping them communicate with each other.
It turns out that,
under Hulseberg's (2016) view,
electronic resource librarianship does this work,
which is pretty cool.
However, the other themes are just as important, and
in particular, Theme Four, about jurisdiction,
highlights one of the major disruptive acts on librarianship
in the last thirty or forty years.</p>
<p>As an example,
consider that most people,
researchers and scholars included,
use non-library provided resources to locate information.
Additionally, more works, scholarly and non-scholarly,
are freely and publicly available on the web,
e.g., as <a href="https://sparcopen.org/open-access/">open access (OA)</a>.
This might mean that the library
<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10355/37582">is becoming disintermediated</a>
as a result of people using non-library services,
like Google or Google Scholar,
to retrieve freely available works on the web,
instead of at the library.
As a result, what becomes of the core jurisdiction of the librarian?
And of the electronic resource librarian, in particular?
In concrete terms: a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-03-2018-0047">recent paper</a> (Klitzing, 2019)
reported that researchers state they use
Google Scholar 83% of the time and
EBSCOhost 29% of the time to find relevant material.
That raises strategic and technical questions about the today's role
of the librarian and library in the scholarly communication system.</p>
<h3 id="to-license-or-not-to-license"><a class="header" href="#to-license-or-not-to-license">To License or Not To License</a></h3>
<p>The third article, by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lisr.2016.02.002">Zhu</a> (2016),
places a different theoretical lens
on what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.
Zhu (2016) posits that the licensing aspect of
electronic resource management significantly influences
ER librarianship identity.
One reason why Zhu's (2016) findings are insightful is
due to the fact that we often license electronic resources
rather than buy them.</p>
<p>The crux centers around copyright law, which
provides librarians
with an important legal justification
for lending works:
the <a href="https://search.copyright.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;affiliate=copyright&amp;sort_by=&amp;query=%22first+sale+doctrine%22">First Sale Doctrine</a>.
Copyright law provides copyright owners with the
right to distribute their work, but
the First Sale Doctrine holds that if you buy a copy of a book,
then you have a right to lend or sell your copy.
This doctrine is fundamental to librarianship but
also raises problems since most digital works
(ebooks, etc)
are licensed and not bought by libraries.
Thus the First Sale Doctrine does not apply
to such works.
That ALA has a guide on this issue
(<a href="https://libguides.ala.org/copyright/firstsale">ALA, 2022</a>).</p>
<p>Stachokas (2018), Hulseberg (2016), and Zhu (2016)
present the historical and environmental forces
that have shaped the work of electronic resource librarians and
their professional identities, and
each of these authors discuss important themes
that function as evidence of these identities.
In our discussions this week,
we should focus on these themes and
how to make sense of it all.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Electronic resource librarianship is a
fascinating areas of librarianship.
Because digital technologies have woven their way
into all parts of the modern library ecosystem,
and because these digital technologies bring with them
a slew of technical, legal, and social challenges,
electronic resource librarians have had,
as these technologies have developed,
to maintain a holistic view of this ecosystem just
as they have had to specialize in key areas that
require maintaining that holistic, interconnected view.</p>
<p>The course takes that holistic view and
divides it into four parts for study.
In the first part,
we will study the nature of the work itself:
what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.</p>
<p>In the second part, we learn about the technologies
that an electronic resource librarian uses and
the conditions that shape these technologies.
We will learn about integrated library systems (ILS) and
how these systems conform (or not) to standards, and
how they foster or obstruct 
interoperability and access.</p>
<p>In the third part, we focus on processes and their contexts.
We will study the electronic resource librarian's workflow,
the economics and the markets of electronic resources,
what is involved in licensing these resources and
negotiating with vendors.</p>
<p>At the end, we focus on patrons and end users;
that is, those we serve. 
Because electronic resources are digital,
when we use them, we leave behind traces of that usage.
This means we will study how that usage is measured and
what those measurements can validly say.
Electronic resources likewise means having to use websites
and other eresource interfaces, and
hence we will study how electronic resource librarians
are involved in user experience studies.
Because usage leaves traces of personal information,
we will end this course on topics related to the
security of these resources and the privacy of those
who use them.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-questions"><a class="header" href="#discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</a></h2>
<p>As we start to address all of this,
I want us to consider two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we manage all of this electronic stuff? Not only
does it include complicated technology and has an impact
on our patrons, but it involves of different sorts of
librarians.</li>
<li>What exactly is an electronic resource librarian? I like
this basic question because, due to perhaps
representations in the media (movies, TV shows, books)
and the interactions we've had with librarians in our
lifetimes, we all have pretty well-defined, whether
