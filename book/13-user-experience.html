<p>Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018) write that &quot;user experience determines the
quality of an interaction being used by an actor in order to achieve a specific
outcome.&quot; Parush (2017) highlights relevant terms like <em>human-computer
interaction (HCI)</em> and <em>usability</em>. Let's say then that HCI encompasses the
entire domain of interaction between people and computers and how that
interaction is designed, whereas <em>user experience (UX)</em> focuses on the quality
of that interaction or an interaction with something (like a product). These
are not precise definitions, and some might use the terms <em>UX</em> and <em>HCI</em>
interchangeably. As ERM librarians, though, it is our job to focus on the
quality of the patron's experience with our electronic services, and this
entails understanding both the systems and technologies involved and the users
interacting with these systems and technologies.</p>
<p>Dickson-Deane and Chen (2018) outline the parameters that are involved with UX.
Let me modify their example and frame it within the context of an ERM
experience for a patron:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actor</strong>: a user of the web resource, like a library website</li>
<li><strong>Object</strong>: the web resource, or some part of it</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: the setting. What's happening? What's the motivation for use?
What's the background knowledge? What's the action?</li>
<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: the tools made available by the object as well as the
look and feel. More specifically, Parush (2017) states that &quot;the user
interface mediates between the user and computer&quot; and it includes three basic
components:
<ul>
<li><em>controls</em>: the tools used to control and interact with the system:
buttons, menus, voice commands, keyboards, etc</li>
<li><em>displays</em>: the information presented to the user or the hardware used to
present the information: screens, speakers, etc.</li>
<li><em>interactions and dialogues</em>: the exchange between the system and the
user including the use of the controls and responding to feedback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interaction</strong>: what the actor is doing with the UI</li>
<li><strong>(Intended/Expected/Prior) User experience</strong>: the intended or expected use
of the object. The user's expectations based on prior use.</li>
<li><strong>(Actual) User experience</strong>: the actions that took place; the actions that
had to be modified based on unintended results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters would be helpful for devising a UX study that involves
observing patrons interacting with a system and then interviewing them to
complete the details. Note that the same kind of systematic thinking can be
applied to evaluate other user experiences, like those between a librarian and
an electronic resource management system. Often the focus is on patron user
experience, but it's just as important to evaluate UX for librarians and to
consider UX when selecting an ERM system or an ILS system.</p>
<p>In any case, these parameters help us step through and highlight the
complicated process of interacting with a computer, generally, or a library
resource, more specifically. As with many other topics we've discussed this
semester, we can also incorporate these parameters into a workflow for
evaluating UX. But, it is because of the complexities involved and a focus on
the systems that Pennington (2015) argues for a more UX centered approach to
library website design. To emphasize their case, think about your own state of
knowledge of ERM before you started to take this course. For example, a number
of you have explored in depth how link resolvers function, and your experience
using them as patrons and your understanding of their technical aspects as
librarians have provided you with a set of skills and experiences that make you
more likely to identify the cause of a malfunction if you find one. But with
the ability to suss out an issue, it becomes easier to solve, and the
experience itself involves less anxiety. Most users and patrons of these
systems will not have any technical knowledge of these systems, and when they
break for them, their frustration with the <strong>experience</strong> might lead to
unfortunate outcomes. For example, they may not retrieve the information they
need; they may not reach out to a librarian; they might stop using the
library's resources in preference for something of inferior quality; and so
forth. We need to not forget that this happens, and if possible, to likewise
design for such failures of a system (because they will fail). How might we,
for instance, design an action to occur when a link resolver or a proxy server
fails to identify and retrieve a work?</p>
<p>Here's the crux. As you gain more skill and expertise with these systems, you
will eventually lose the ability to see these systems as a novice user, and
that distance will only grow over time. It is therefore, as Pennington (2015)
argues, important to gather data from users. User experience research nurtures
a user centered mindset.</p>
<p>The second article by Pennington, Chapman, Fry, Deschenes, and McDonald (2016)
is a contribution from four librarians with theoretical and practical
suggestions for UX research. Both Pennington and Chapman note the best way to
measure UX or detect UX issues is to conduct research with users (recall our
conversations on proactive troubleshooting), but this isn't always possible due
to financial, time, or other constraints. However, there is a wealth of
research on UX and in the absence of the ability to conduct research, locating
prior research and applying that research to your setting is paramount. Drawing
from the literature, Chapman describes several important UX principles that
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>chunking</li>
<li>highlighting and prominence</li>
<li>KISS</li>
<li>choice simplification</li>
<li>choice reduction</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to user studies and prior research, libraries possess a wealth of
data to explore and this data could provide a lot of insight. The same caveat
applies that Chapman described: if only you have time to analyze the data. But
Fry points out that you can access library data about location of user, device
type, resource use, and more. (There are some privacy issues involved with
this, and we'll talk about them at the end of the semester.) Furthermore,
here's where the Browning (2015) article is helpful. Whereas Fry describes what
we can learn from data about usage, Browning describes what we can learn from
data about breakage. Both kinds of data can offer us a substantial
understanding about user experience.</p>
<p>If you can conduct a user study, then Deschenes offers helpful tips on
recruiting users. Remember that the users that you recruit should be actual
users of the systems. If you are interested in why some segments of the
population do not use the library's resources, then that would be a different
kind of study.</p>
<p>I agree with McDonald that despite having around 30 or so years of experience
with web-based electronic resources, more with other types of electronic
resources that existed prior to the web and that were based on the then
internet, on optical disks, etc., we are still in the throes of disruption.
There's a lot yet to learn about design for the web, just like there's a lot of
left to learn about how to design a home or office, and nothing will be settled
for a while. Although I doubt if there will be any single dominate user
experience or user interface, since there are many cultures and backgrounds and
experiences, I'm fairly sure the low-hanging fruit problems will work out
eventually. Remember though that 95% of the cause of all of this is due to
copyright issues, which necessitate the entire electronic resource ecosystem
and the complications that are introduced by having to work with vendors who
work with different, but overlapping, publishers, etc. If something were to
change about copyright, then it's a whole new ballgame.</p>
<p>On a final note, you might be wondering how <em>information seeking</em> is related to
<em>HCI</em> and to <em>UX</em>. Anytime we interact with a computer (broadly speaking) in
order to seek information, then we have an overlap. But there are areas of
non-overlap, too. We don't always use computers to look for information, and we
don't always look for information on computers. <em>UX</em> is like this, too. <em>UX</em> is
not always about computers but can be about user experience generally. I bring
this up because if you do become involved with <em>UX</em> work at a library (or
elsewhere), then I'd encourage you to refer also to the information seeking and
related literature when it's appropriate to do so. Remember, it's all
interconnected.</p>
