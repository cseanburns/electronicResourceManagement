<p>We've discussed problems this semester with defining terms, and we have learned
that a lot of effort has been expended into standardizing them. We have also
seen that the topics that we've covered---technologies, standards, access,
usability, workflow, markets, licensing---are linked in some way. All this
complexity makes the measurement of <em>usage</em> that much more complicated. The
problem is that when electronic resources (or basically all activity on the web
and internet) are accessed, a computer server somewhere keeps a log of that
interaction. Having logs available makes it seem that we can have accurate data
about usage, but it's not a guarantee, and the insight we may be able to glean
is always difficult to acquire no matter how much data is available to us.</p>
<p>Example web server access log entry (I've obfuscated the IP address and the
website domain):</p>
<pre><code>99.999.99.99 - - [21/Oct/2021:10:54:35 -0400] &quot;GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1&quot; 404 517 &quot;https://WEBSITE.edu/&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/93.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Access log type data can be good data to explore, but we have to be mindful
that all data has limitations, and that there are different ways to define what
usage means. For example, the log snippet above indicates that I visited that
link at that server, but does that mean that I really <strong>used</strong> that website
even though I accessed it? Even if we can claim that I did, what kind of use
was it? Can we tell? (We can actually learn quite a lot from web server access
logs.)</p>
<p>This week we learn about the efforts that have gone into standardizing usage
metrics and usage reports via Project Counter. Also, we see a few examples of
how usage data can help inform collection development and benefit the library
in other ways. This is an important area of electronic resource librarianship,
but it's also an area that may overlap with other parts of librarianship, such
as systems librarianship or collection development. Here we might see job
titles like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=library+systems+administrator">library systems administrator</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="./14-evaluation-statistics.html#project-counter" id="project-counter"><h2>Project Counter</h2></a>
<p>Project Counter is a Code of Practice that seeks to help provide more
informative and consistent reporting of electronic resource usage. From
<a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/introduction-to-counter-code-of-practice-release-5/">Project Counter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its inception in 2002, COUNTER has been focused on providing a code of
practice that helps ensure librarians have access to consistent, comparable,
and credible usage reporting for their online scholarly information. COUNTER
serves librarians, content providers, and others by facilitating the
recording and exchange of online usage statistics. The COUNTER Code of
Practice provides guidance on data elements to be measured and definitions of
these data elements, as well as guidelines for output report content and
formatting and requirements for data processing and auditing. To have their
usage statistics and reports designated COUNTER compliant, content providers
MUST provide usage statistics that conform to the current Code of Practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, these reports were designed to help solve a problem that will likely
never completely be solved, but it's still an important and useful effort. The
main goal of Counter is to provide usage reports, and the reports, for version
5 of Counter, cover four major areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Titles</li>
<li>Items</li>
</ul>
<p>And you can see which reports these four replace in <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/2448-2/">a table in Appendix B of
the Code of Practice</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/foreword/">Counter 5</a> was designed to include better reporting consistency,
better clarity of metrics that measure usage activity, better views of the
data, and more. In order to clarify the purpose of Counter, let's review the
introduction to the <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/introduction-to-counter-code-of-practice-release-5/">Code of Practice</a>, which articulates the
purpose, scope, application, and more of Counter.</p>
<p>[ Note: Review the Introduction to the Code of Practice ]</p>
<a class="header" href="./14-evaluation-statistics.html#readings" id="readings"><h2>Readings</h2></a>
<p><a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2017.1391153">Pesch (2017)</a> provides a helpful introduction to the history of
Project Counter and the migration from Counter version 4 to version 5. Table 1
in Pesch describes the four major reports. Most of the reports are
self-explanatory. Database, Title, and Item reports cover what they describe,
but Platform reports might be less obvious. These reports include usage metrics
at the broadest level and of things like EBSCOhost databases, ProQuest
databases, SAGE resources, Web of Science databases, and so on. These reports
come into play when users/patrons search in the overall platform but not in any
single database provided by the platform. For example, UK Libraries subscribes
to the ProQuest Databases and for us, that includes <a href="https://www.proquest.com/databases/advanced?accountid=11836">35 primary
databases</a>. Users can search many at the same time or search any single
one. The same holds for platforms like EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and others.
This is the platform level.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0361526X.2016.1165783">Scott (2016)</a> article provides a nice use case for how Counter
reports can inform collection development. We've talked a bit about the <em>Big
Deal</em> packages that more libraries are trying to move away from because such
deals often include access to titles that are not used or not relevant to a
library community. Here Scott shows that it might be possible to avoid
subscribing to some services using this data, but it's also important to
closely read through and understand the problems associated with interlibrary
loan, the metrics, and other limitations described in the Conclusion section of
this article.</p>
<p>We move away from Project Counter with the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5860/crl12-406">Stone and Ramsden
(2013)</a> article. I wanted to introduce this article because it
highlights how metrics can be used to assess the value of a library, which is
often underestimated by administration but constantly required in order to
garner the resources needed to improve or sustain a library's resources. Here
Stone and Ramsden investigate the correlation (not causation) between library
usage and student retention. Increasing the latter is the Holy Grail of college
and universities. If this were a public library report, it might be interesting
to see how well electronic library usage correlates to continued usage and how
such a correlation might result in various outcomes defined by the library. One
nice thing about the Stone and Ramsden article is that it does not depend on
quantitative metrics alone but supports its findings through qualitative
research. There's only so much a usage metric can say.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like you to be aware of the <a href="https://code4lib.org/"><em>code{4}lib</em> journal</a>
and this article by <a href="https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10589">Zou</a> is pretty cool. Although this article overlaps
with some security issues, a topic that we'll cover in our last week of the
semester, the article also provides a way of thinking outside the box about the
metrics that you'll have access to as an electronic resource librarian. Here,
Zou describes a process of taking EZproxy logs (compare the example entry with
the web server entry I included above) and turning them into something useful
and dynamic by incorporating some additional technologies. Recall that
<a href="https://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html">EZproxy</a> is software that authenticates users and provides access
given that authentication. We use EZproxy at UK whenever we access a paywalled
journal article. That is, you've noticed the <strong>ezproxy.uky.edu</strong> string in any
URL for a journal that you've accessed via UK Libraries' installation of
EZproxy, and the URL <code>https://login.ezproxy.uky.edu/login</code> is the log in URL.
Zou specifically references <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210716020704/https://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/post/analyzing-ezproxy-logs/">the standard way</a> of analyzing these logs
(take a look at the page at that link), which can be insightful and helpful,
but Zou's method makes the analysis of these logs more visual and real-time.
The main weakness with Zou's method is that it seems to me to be highly
dependent on Zou doing the work. If Zou leaves their library, then this
customized analysis might not last. Still, it's good to know that if you have
an interest in developing skills with systems administration, with various
other technologies, and with some basic scripting language, this kind of thing,
and more, is possible.</p>
