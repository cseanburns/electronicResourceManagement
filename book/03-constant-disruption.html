<p>The first listed reading we have this week is by Marshall Breeding. Astute
observers will note Breeding is one of the first cited in the two additional
readings we have this week. We will read more from Breeding later in the
semester, but I bring him up now because he oversees a website titled <a href="https://librarytechnology.org/">Library
Technology Guides</a> at librarytechnology.org. If you would like to
keep abreast of the recent news on the electronic resource industry, Breeding's
website should be at the top of your list.</p>
<p>Breeding's <em>What is ERM?</em> article is a good one to start the week. He provides
a nice outline of the various components of electronic resources, and he
provides some historical context for those components.</p>
<p>One caveat, though: while all the articles on our list this week are focused on
academic libraries, the terms, concepts, and processes described in these
articles are relevant to other areas of librarianship such as public
librarianship, school media librarianship, and so forth. Differences in
processes and in some details will arise due to organizational or other
contextual differences among these library types. Organizationally, for
example, public libraries are connected to municipalities, county governments,
state libraries, and to public library consortia. This presents unique
organizational challenges, and it highlights the fact that municipal, county,
or state laws will define how some processes must be handled and who must
handle them. The same is true for public schools, and in such cases, school
boards and school districts will likely be involved. Contextual differences
that shape electronic resource management include user communities. An academic
library serves its students, faculty, staff, and perhaps the public to some
degree. However, a public library serves its local community. Such differences
will shape ERM workflows and other choices, like the chosen vendors and
publishers. For example, academic libraries will require more scholarly
sources, and public libraries provide more ebooks and audiobooks and less
e-journals. This means that you might find services like OverDrive/Libby
offered by public libraries but not in academic, and that you will rarely find
more advanced scholarly resources in public libraries. These differences in
needs, due to different communities, will change the emphasis on some aspects
of the ERM work flow.</p>
<p>Another reason why our reading lists lean toward the academic setting is
because academic librarians publish more about electronic resources and public
librarians publish very little. For example, I conducted a search in <strong>LISTA</strong>
with the following query, which returned just three results.</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>It does not get much better if I expand the query to include some additional
thesauri terms. This query returns only six results:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;PUBLIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;PUBLIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>However, if I focus that query on academic libraries, then the results increase
substantially. The following query returns 51 hits:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And this query returns 82 results:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarians&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC librarianship&quot; OR DE &quot;ACADEMIC libraries&quot;) AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC resource librarians&quot; OR  DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>We could continue to explore <strong>LISTA</strong> or other databases for relevant
material, but you get the picture. There simply isn't a lot of material on
electronic resource management from the public library perspective, and a quick
search in the school media sphere mirrors this issue, too. The following search
return zero results:</p>
<pre><code>(DE &quot;LIBRARY media specialists&quot;)  AND  (DE &quot;ELECTRONIC information resources management&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>If you go into public librarianship or school media librarianship, I'd
encourage you to publish on electronic resources. It would greatly benefit your
peers and those of us who teach courses like this.</p>
<p>Back to Breeding. I understand some terms Breeding uses and the technologies he
describes might be foreign right now. I am not rehashing or summarizing these
articles here because I want to discuss them on the boards, but let me spend
some time providing some additional background information and highlighting
some things to look for in these three articles.</p>
<p>Librarians started to migrate to electronic resource management in the 1970s.
Breeding mentions this. This is when it happened en masse, but the seeds were
planted well before this. I published <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/534487">a paper</a> a few years ago that
provides a historical account of the first library automation project, which
took place in the 1930s with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">Hollerith punched cards</a>. By the
1960s, the primary use of computers was to manage circulation, and in the late
60s and early 70s, library automation focused on managing patron records. In
the early 1970s, tools became available to manage and search bibliographic
records. Hence, computers were first used mostly to manage the circulation of
books, then patron records, which allowed patrons to check out works
electronically, and then we had the ability to search for works. If a work of
interest was located using these tools, the work could be retrieved from the
shelves or ordered via interlibrary loan by snail mail. Full text search came
much later with the introduction of better storage media, like CD-ROMs, and saw
major growth with the introduction of the web in the early 1990s, which at its
heart is nothing more than a big document retrieval system.</p>
<p>In the process of migrating from print to electronic, all sorts of things had
to change, but all that change rests on the major premise of librarianship: <em>to
provide access by organizing information in order to retrieve information</em>.
Although you may have often heard that libraries are ancient entities,
libraries and librarianship as we understand them today did not modernize until
the 1920s and 1930s. It was then that some in the profession began to hone in
on the major complexities and challenges, social and technological, involved in
<strong>organizing</strong> and <strong>retrieving</strong> information in order to provide <strong>access</strong>.
The challenges with organizing and retrieving information that they identified
nearly 100 years ago were indeed major and problematic, but fortuitous, because
it gave rise to what we now called <em>library science</em>, the rigorous study of
libraries, librarianship, collections, users, communities, and so forth.</p>
<p>Yet consider when those people laid the groundwork for a library science nearly
100 years ago, librarians only managed print and the primary means of accessing
print collections was through a physical building. With the introduction of
computer systems in the 1960s and with better networking technologies in the
1980s and 1990s, issues with organizing and retrieving information grew
exponentially, and indeed, this exponential increase in complex issues launched
an entire new field, what we now call <em>information science</em>.</p>
<p>All right, back to the ground level. Let me highlight some key terms in
Breeding's article. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding aids</li>
<li>Knowledge bases</li>
<li>OpenURL link resolvers</li>
<li>ERM systems</li>
<li>Library service platforms</li>
<li>Integrated library systems (ILS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you already have some solid experience with these things, and even after
reading Breeding's nice article, these terms may still be abstract. So, this
week, you have two major tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find real, practical examples. Pick one or two of the above terms and see
how they work in practice. Then come back here and tell us what you found.
Use the articles to help you locate actual products or examples.</li>
<li>Locate how these terms appear in either the Cote and Ostergaard (2017)
article or the Fu and Carmen (2015). Note other terms that may appear in
those two articles and comment on the role they play in the ERM work flow
and the migration process.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you work on this task, I ask that you pay attention to the emphasis on work
flow. The idea of a <strong>work flow</strong> is a major theme in this course because it is
a major part of electronic resource management. We'll come back to the idea
over and over this semester. Also, as we read the Cote and Ostergaard and the
Fu and Carmen articles, we will learn about how migrating to new systems is a
major, expensive, and time-consuming project, and one of the great things about
these two articles is that it documents the work flows used in these
migrations. If you become involved some day in a migration process, you should
use articles like these to assist you and to help you make evidence-based
decisions about what you need to accomplish. And like what these authors have
done, I'd encourage you to document and publish what you learned. In the print
era, there were some cases where librarians had to migrate to new systems, too.
For example, some research libraries in the U.S. started by classifying
collections using the Dewey Decimal Classification system, but then began to
convert to the Library of Congress Classification system. This was no small
task, but it was also not that common. Today, migration is big business in the
library world (see Breeding's site for other examples) because the technology
changes fast and because there are a number of competing electronic resource
management products that librarians can choose for their communities, which
they might be inclined to do if the migration provides an advantage to their
users, communities, and themselves.</p>
