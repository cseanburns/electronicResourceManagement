<p>This week we will be learning about ERM and ILS software. First off, what are
these?</p>
<a class="header" href="./04-erm-ils.html#ils-the-integrated-library-system" id="ils-the-integrated-library-system"><h2>ILS, the Integrated Library System</h2></a>
<p><strong>ILS</strong> is an acronym for an <strong>integrated library system</strong>. We've also been
introduced to the term <strong>library services platform (LSP)</strong>. Our discussions of
the ILS this week are relevant to those types of an ILS that may also be an
LSP, which are increasingly more common these days.</p>
<p>Regardless, each of you are familiar with an ILS/LSP from a user perspective
and some of you are familiar with these systems from a librarian perspective.
In your lifetimes, you have used an OPAC (online public access catalog) or a
<strong>discovery</strong> interface, you have likely conducted a search for a serial, and
you have most definitely borrowed a print book from a library. These are the
kinds of kinds of functions that an ILS provides for library users.</p>
<p>An ILS also provides an administrative interface that librarians use to manage
those processes. This interface includes functions to manage acquisitions,
cataloging, circulation, and serials, and the OPAC, where the interfaces to
these in the ILS are referred to as <strong>modules</strong>. You should read about these
modules in the open source ILS called <a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen</a> by sifting through
some of Evergreen's documentation.</p>
<p>Hence, the ILS generally provides two separate interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>administrative interface</strong> to be used by librarians to manage the tasks
per the modules</li>
<li>a <strong>public interface</strong> for patrons to access the works of a library</li>
</ul>
<p>Tasks that an ILS provides include modules that cover:</p>
<p>Administrative:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/acquisitions/">Acquisitions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/cataloging/">Cataloging</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/circulation/">Circulation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/serials/">Serials</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Public:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/reorg/3.2/opac/">OPAC</a> interface</li>
<li><a href="https://scholarship.rollins.edu/as_facpub/138/">Discovery</a> interface</li>
</ul>
<p>An ILS is therefore, as Stephen Salmon stated in 1975, a non-traditional way of
doing traditional things, such as &quot;acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation,&quot;
but which is now fairly traditional! Some librarians who would work with an ILS
include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reference: who use the OPAC or discovery interface</li>
<li>Cataloging and Technical Services: who use the cataloging and serial's
modules and perhaps also the acquisition's module</li>
<li>Circulation: who would use the circulation module
<ul>
<li>Interlibrary Loan department: if such a department exists because the
library is big enough to have one, they would also use the circulation
module</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of those librarians might use multiple modules of the ILS, but might
predominately use one module more frequently than others in their day-to-day
work. For example, when I worked in reference at a small academic library, I
used the Millennium ILS to check out books to users, to fix borrowing issues,
and to search for works in the OPAC. Later I used the cataloging module when I
moved to technical services. However, what a librarian uses frequently depends
on the organizational structure of a library. As our reading by Miller, Sharp,
and Jones (2014) show, the rise in electronic resources has vastly influenced
the ways librarians structure their organizations, whose structure was
originally informed by the dictates of a &quot;print-based world&quot;. In those
structures, librarians may either hold positions where their work is
streamlined and focused on one task, such as collections, or on multiple tasks.</p>

<a class="header" href="./04-erm-ils.html#erm-the-electronic-resource-management-system" id="erm-the-electronic-resource-management-system"><h2>ERM, the Electronic Resource Management System</h2></a>
<p>ERM is an acronym for <em>electronic resource management</em> system. Its function is
born out of the need to manage digital assets and provide users with access to
those assets. An ERM may or may not be integrated, as one product, with a
library's ILS software. ERM software is primarily a behind the scenes software.
Similar to the ILS, ERM software is generally divided into modules that focus
the librarian's work on particular duties and allow librarians to create work
flows and knowledge management systems. In an ERM like the open source <a href="http://coral-erm.org/modules/">CORAL
system</a>, the modules includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/resources/">Resources</a>: a module &quot;provides a robust database for
tracking data related to your organization's resources ...&quot; and &quot;provides a
customizable workflow tool that can be used to track, assign, and complete
workflow tasks.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/licensing/">Licensing</a>: a module for a &quot;flexible document management
system&quot; that provides options to manage licensing agreements and to automate
parts of the process.</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/organizations/">Organizations</a>: this module acts as a type of advanced
directory to manage the various organizations that impact or are involved in
the management of electronic resources, including &quot;publishers, vendors,
consortia, and more.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/usage-statistics/">Usage Statistics</a>: a module providing librarians with
usage statistics of digital assets by platform and by publisher. Supports
COUNTER and SUSHI. We'll cover COUNTER and SUSHI later in the semester, but
as a preamble:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/about/counter-for-libraries/">COUNTER</a> &quot;sets and maintains the standard known as the Code of
Practice and ensures that publishers and vendors submit annually to a
rigorous independent audit&quot;, and,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/sushi">SUSHI</a> is a type of protocol to automate collecting data on usage
statistics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://coral-erm.org/management/">Management</a>: this module provides a document management
system aimed at &quot;storing documents, such as policies, processes, and
procedures, related to the overall management of electronic resources&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our readings this week, we have three articles that speak to ILS and ERM
software as well as the relationship between the two, and an additional article
that offers organizational context. The first reading, by Miller, Sharp, and
Jones (2014) provides some context by describing a case study (the literature
review is also helpful) that shows how electronic resources have impacted
organizational structure, job titles, budgets, and more. The article by
Anderson (2014) lists and describes various ERM solutions. As I mentioned in a
previous lecture, electronic resources is a fast moving area, and even though
this article (or chapter) is a handful of years old, some products are no
longer available, have been merged into others, or sold off. Still, the article
is helpful in describing:</p>
<ul>
<li>the role of vendors in the ERM market</li>
<li>the importance and rise of open source ERMs as well as the mark that various
homegrown solutions have made</li>
<li>related software that plays a role, including:
<ul>
<li>Discovery: federated and indexed</li>
<li>Integrated library systems</li>
<li>Interlibrary loan software</li>
<li>Link resolvers</li>
<li>Ticket management software</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the article by Wang &amp; Dawes (2012), the authors describe the &quot;next
generation integrated library system&quot;, which should meet a few criteria that
include the ability to merge ILS software with ERM software, the latter having
come into creation because of the lack of development among ILS systems, which
were stagnating and not responding to changing work flows and work formats
(i.e., print to electronic) at the time. But around the time the article was
published, more ILS and ERM software began moving to the cloud, as was common
among many software markets. This changed the game, too, because it placed a
bigger burden on software companies to maintain development of the work.</p>
<p>Despite the technical aspects of these solutions, at its basic, both ILS and
ERM software solutions focus on managing assets (books, serials,
<a href="https://archives.yale.edu/subjects/33488">realia</a>, etc) so that librarians can organize and users and librarians
can retrieve them. There's no requirement to use any solution offered by a
library vendor, and that's the point of the Wilson (2011) article, which shows
how regular software can be used to function as a homegrown solution for
creating and implementing an ERM work flow.</p>
<p>In this week's forum, I'll introduce you to the Evergreen ILS and to the CORAL
ERM solution and to its various modules and how they work. Be sure to open the
transcript for this lecture in order to visit the links, especially the
documentation. I ask that you log into these two services using the
instructions on their sites. This will help you get some hands-on experience
with them and also demystify what each do.</p>
