# Lecture 11: Licensing and Negotiating

Since we are watching a long video again and also have a solid number of
readings, I will keep this lecture short.

Let's talk about Abbie Brown, first. In her talk, note that she highlights the
middle ground on:

  - principled negotiation
  - assertive communicators

She also discusses, based on her experience, some stereotypes that get in the
way of negotiating. These include:

  - Librarian stereotypes: I was at a dinner with a friend of mine and their
    family when my friend mentioned me going to library school. The father of
    my friend then said, "isn't that women's work?" So this stereotype is true,
    and you will likely have to deal with it, and if you identify as a woman,
    then you will likely be pre-judged on appearance, by associating your name
    with a gender, or like. My advice is to stick with Abbie Brown's suggestion
    to focus on principle negotiation and assertive communication. And if
    you're judged based on other stereotypes, don't tolerate that.
  - Library stereotypes: libraries are major players in the economy and have
    important economic buying power. Know that you come from this position.
  - Vendors stereotypes: these are just as incorrect. As Brown notes, the
    people who work for vendors often have Master's degrees from library
    science programs. In fact, I went to library school with people who now
    work for vendors, and these people are certainly aware of the complexities
    surrounding libraries and librarians and the values that librarians uphold.
    So you often will have a lot of mutual understanding from the start.
  - End the end, try work against any and all of these stereotypes. I think
    that if you do this, then this will reduce a lot of anxiety that we might
    carry with us when we go to the negotiating table.

I like that also that she stresses the importance of building and maintaining
relationships:

  - Focus from the beginning on building a good relationship with your vendor.
    There are many technical, product and other types of benefits to this, as
    Abbie Brown lists.

Brown's practical suggestions:

  - talk through things, with colleagues and vendors
  - write well and succinctly, and put in writing
  - I know that some of you have already had hesitations about the licensing
    agreements we've discussed already. Brown covers this in some detail and in
    real world ways and discusses how, e.g., SERU, is not always used but is
    still helpful to have out there.

In addition to Brown's talk, we are also reading a few articles. The Smith and
Hartnett article is another nice real world example of the negotiating process
that includes a work flow around licensing. Remember, document everything!
That's how these checklists have come into being and why they're useful. Having
a work flow in place around licensing will help make the entire process more
efficient and help ensure that all bases are covered.

The Dygert and Barrett article covers the specifics of licensing---what to look
for, what shouldn't be given away, how to negotiate, principally, and more.
Likewise, the Dunie article also gets into specifics that include the
negotiation process but also that include definitions of terms, business
models, strategies, and more.

This week will not necessarily prepare us to become negotiators. The main point
I want to make this week is this: if you find yourself in a position where you
one of your job responsibilities is to negotiate with vendors for e-resources
(or for anything else), then come back to these sources of information and
spend additional time studying them and taking notes on them. Sources like
these, and others like them in the literature, will definitely prepare you
after great study.
