# Lecture 10: Licensing Basics

This week we start our two-week coverage on licensing issues. Licensing is at
the top of the list of most important aspects of electronic resource
management. 

The readings are pretty straightforward, but let's preview some basics, which
are nicely outlined in Weir (2016) (not in the reading but reference below):

- There is a difference between copyright law and contract law. In short,
  contract law overrides copyright law. This is why, for example, authors may
  sign over their copyrights to publishers, among other things.
- There are two general types of licensing agreements:
    - **End user agreements** are generally the kind that people accept when they
      use some kind of software or some service. 
    - **Site agreements** are the kinds of agreements librarians get involved in
      when they negotiate for things like databases. Here, *site* refers to the
      organizational entity.
- There are several important parts of a standard license. They include:
    - **Introductions**: this includes information about the licensee and the
      licensor, date information, some information about payments and the
      schedule.
    - **Definitions**: this section defines the major terms of the contract. Weir
      includes, as examples, the licensee, the licensor, authorized
      user, user population, and whether the contract entails a single or
      multi-user site.
    - **Access**: This covers topics such as IP authentication and proxy access.
    - Acceptable use: Included here are issues related to downloading, storage,
      print rights, interlibrary loan (ILL), preservation.
    - **Prohibited use**: What cannot people do: download restrictions, etc.
    - **Responsibilities**: What is the licensee (the library) responsible for. Be
      careful about accepting responsibility for actions that the library would
      have a difficult time monitoring. Then also, what is the licensor
      responsible for. This might include topics such as 24 hour access and
      like.
    - **Term and terminations**: Details about the terms of the contract and how
      the contract may be terminated. Be aware that many libraries are attached
      to either municipal, county, or state governments and must adhere to
      relevant laws.
    - Various provisions

As an example, the California Digital Library, via the University of
California, provides a [checklist][checklist] and a copy of their standard license
agreement.

The checklist covers four main sections and is well worth a read:

- Content and Access
- Licensing
- Business
- Management

We have three additional readings this week. One of the readings covers SERU:
A Shared Electronic Resource Understanding, by NISO. We also have a short
article by Regan that provides some guidelines on becoming competent on
licensing.

[SERU][seru2], [Shared Electronic Resource Understanding][seru3], is another NISO
collaborative document that helped standardize some aspects of the licensing
process and can be used as "an alternative to a license agreement" if
a provider and a library agrees to its use. Like the standard licensing
structure that Weir (2016) outlines, SERU also includes parts that describe
use, inappropriate use, access, and more, but also posits other stipulations,
such as confidentiality and privacy.

The other reading is the [NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources
Librarians][nasig_cc]. This doesn't specifically cover licensing, but I added it to
this week's reading list for a couple of reasons. First, it's a reminder that
when we talk about electronic resource management, we talk about
a comprehensive list of responsibilities, skills, technologies, and more, and
I need to keep this on our radar. Second, because the Regan reading
specifically mentions these competencies, and I thought it would good to
introduce them here, even though many of you have already commented on them in
previous discussion forums.

This week, after reading the material, I want you to focus on the Regan article
and some of the questions raised there. Regan raises important questions about
the licensing process and about effective communication and advocacy. This
week, I want you to comment on these things, and I want you to answer some of
the questions that Regan raises. You can do that by searching the web and
library websites. In fact, at the beginning of the semester I asked you to
subscribe to the SERIALST email list. It's now time to draw upon that and any
discussions you've seen in those lists that are related. You can usually search
the archives of those lists, if you want. Regan also mentions some other
sources, such as [LIBLICENSE][liblicense] and [copyrightlaws.com][cclaws]. Any of these are
fair game for discussing, but the latter is a commercial entity that provides
material and tutorials for a kind of tuition. It might be useful to know about
it but explore only if you want. However, LIBLICENSE provides model licenses as
well as links to [additional model licences][add_models], including the above mentioned
California Digital Library Standard License Agreement. The LIBLICENSE model
license includes even more details, such as types of authorized uses, and the
new ones include:

- course reserves
- course packs
- electronic links
- scholarly sharing
- scholarly citation
- text and data mining
