# Standardizing Terms for Electronic Resource Management
## Date: Thu 06 Feb 2019 

A few years ago now, I conducted some basic historical research on a
librarian named Ralph Parker. Inspired by technological advances in
automation, specifically the punched card, Parker began to work out how
to apply this technology to library circulation starting in the 1930s,
and ended up becoming the first person to automate part of the library's
work flow. By the mid-1960s, Parker's continued pursuit of library
automation led to some major advances, including the founding of OCLC,
and the punched card system he developed over many years led to massive
increases in circulation and better service to patrons. After making
these advances, he wrote in the mid-60s the following about the
installation and launch of a new punched card system to help automate
circulation:

> "To the delight of the patrons it requires only four seconds to check
> out materials" (as cited in Burns, 2013).

Think about that comment for a second and recognize how delighted not
only the patrons must have been but also the librarians, such that the
time was reduced to four seconds. Imagine how long it took before this
reduction was accomplished.

Technology does, in some or many cases, lead to progress, but progress
and influence are more involved than that. Change comes not just from
nifty new technological developments or from the application of
technologies, but also from the standardization of technology. Standards
enable multiple groups of competing interests to form consensus about
how technology should work, and when this happens, multiple parties
receive payoffs at the expense of any one party acquiring a monopoly.
This is true for things as simple as the design of screwdrivers, the
width of railroad tracks, the temperature scale, and certainly also to
how information is managed and exchanged. The internet and the web
wouldn't exist, or definitely not exist as we know it, if not for the
standardization of the Internet Protocol (IP), the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and other
internet and web related technologies that make the internet and the web
work for so many users regardless of the operating system and the
hardware they use. 

Our first article this week is written by Pat Harris and covers the
basic reasons for the existence of [NISO][1] (the National Information
Standards Organization) and the kinds of standards NISO is responsible
for maintaining and creating. If you haven't before paid attention to
NISO, you might now start seeing more references to the organization and
the standards it publishes, especially because the international library
community has worked closely with NISO to develop standards for various
aspects of library work.

Historical note: As Harris points out in the article, NISO came into
existence in the mid-1930s. This was about the same time that Ralph
Parker, mentioned above, began working on his punched card system. Not
long before this, in the late 1920s, the first library science graduate
program launched at the University of Chicago, and in the early 1930s,
the first research based journal started, *The Library Quarterly*. We
often talk about how long libraries have existed, and it's true that
there were quite a few accomplishments before the 1930s, but it's this
time period (for these and a number of other reasons) that really marks
the modern era of libraries.

Our additional readings are about TERMS, or Techniques for Electronic
Resource Management. TERMS is not a true standard, but more of a *de
facto* one that helps outline the electronic resource management work
flow. It was developed in order for librarians or others dealing with
electronic resources to come to a consensus about the processes and
parts of electronic resource management. The first version of TERMS is
described by the TERMS authors in the *Library Technology Reports*
readings of chapters 1-8. Although it has been replaced by a [newer
version][6], it still functions as a thorough introduction to the ERM
work flow and provides guidance and suggestions about all aspects of
electronic resource management. For example, in [chapter 7][7] of the
LTS report on TERMS version 1, the authors provide very helpful
information on the importance of working with providers or vendors in
case of cancellation of a resource. They write:

> Do not burn any bridges! Many resources have postcancellation access,
> which means you need to keep up a working relationship with suppliers;
> this might also incur a platform access fee going forward, so this
> needs to be budgeted for in future years. Review the license to fully
> understand what your postcancellation rights to access may be. In
> addition, you may resubscribe to the resources in future years.
> Content is bought and sold by publishers and vendors. Therefore, you
> may end up back with your original vendor a year or two down the line!

Some of this material is repeated in version 2 of TERMS, but version 2
was created in order to address some changes in the world and to include
more input from the community. Version 2 also includes a slightly
modified outline, and [includes the following parts][8]:

1. Investigating new content for purchase or addition
2. Acquiring new content
3. Implementation
4. Ongoing evaluation and access, and annual review
5. Cancellation and replacement review
6. Preservation

At the same link just provided, they also write about this new version:

> In addition to the works mentioned or cited in the original TERMS
> report, much has been written in the past few years that can help the
> overwhelmed or incoming electronic resources librarian manage their
> daily workflow. In the end, however, most of the challenges facing the
> management of electronic resources is directly related to workflow
> management. How we manage these challenging or complex resources is
> more important than what we do, because how we do it informs how
> successful and how meaningful the work is, and how well it completes
> our goal of getting access to patrons who want to use these resources.

As such, the outline and the content described in these two versions of
TERMS is very much about centered on the ERM work flow. Thus, TERMS is
essentially a guide and framework for thinking about the different parts
of the electronic resource life cycle within the library, and helps
provide librarians with a set of questions and points of investigation.
For example, let's consider the first TERM, which is to investigate new
content for purchase or addition. In a presentation by the [Emery and
Stone (2014)][2], they suggest that this involves the following steps,
partly paraphrased:

- outline what you want to achieve
- create a specification document
- assemble the right team
- review the market and literature and set up trial
- speak with suppliers and vendors
- make a decision (Emery and Stone, slide 12, 2014)

Emery and Stone provide other examples, and the TERMS listed in this
slide are from the first version. TERM 6, PRESERVATION, was added in
version 2, and TERMS 4 and 5 were joined together. There's a link to
these slides, with further examples, in the transcript of this lecture,
as well as the citation.

This week you have two part exercise: first, you'll visit the NISO
website and search for documentation on a standard, technical report, or
recommended best practice and post about it. Second, after reading about
TERMS and perusing through the slides, try to place these TERMS in
additional electronic resource management context. Please draw from
experience or use your imagination.

I'm requiring a lot of reading this week because these readings really
capture the specifics of the ERM work flow, and understanding them will
help you get started and attain success in this position. The Rinck
article is a nice interview with the authors of TERMS. Consider this
optional reading, but its still worthy of your time.
