# Lecture 5: Standardizing Terms for Electronic Resource Management

Awhile ago now, I conducted some historical research on a librarian named Ralph
Parker. Inspired by technological advances in automation, specifically the
punched card, Parker began to apply this technology to library circulation
starting in the 1930s, and ended becoming the first person to automate part of
the library's work flow. By the mid-1960s, Parker's continued pursuit of
library automation led to some major advances, including the founding of OCLC,
and the punched card system he developed over the decades led to massive
increases in circulation and better service to patrons. After making these
advances, in the mid-60s he wrote on the installation and launch of a new
punched card system to help automate circulation:

> To the delight of the patrons it requires only four seconds to check
> out materials (as cited in Burns, 2014).

I think on that comment often, because when I read that in his annual report,
I could feel his giddiness with the results. Until this achievement, when
a patron borrowed an item from the library, the process involved completing
multiple forms. It was drudgery work, but this achievement improved the library
experience for patrons as well as the librarians at the circulation desk,
directly, and their colleagues throughout the library because it also had the
effect of substantially increasing circulation.

Technology does, in some or many cases, lead to progress, but progress and
influence are more involved than that. Change comes not just from nifty new
technological developments or from the application of technologies, but also
from the standardization of technology. Standards enable multiple groups of
competing interests to form consensus around how technology should work, and
when this happens, multiple parties receive payoffs at the expense of any
single party acquiring a monopoly. This is true for the design of screwdrivers,
the width of railroad tracks, the temperature scale, and certainly also to how
information is managed and exchanged. The internet and the web wouldn't exist,
or definitely not exist as we know it, if not for the standardization of the
Internet Protocol (IP), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and other internet and web related technologies that
enable the internet and the web to work for so many users regardless of the
operating system and the hardware they use. 

Our first article this week is written by Pat Harris and covers the basic
reasons for the existence of [NISO][niso] (the National Information Standards
Organization) and the kinds of standards NISO is responsible for maintaining
and creating. These standards are directly related to libraries and fall under
[three broad categories][niso2] related to **Information Creation &amp; Curation**,
**Information Discovery &amp; Interchange**, and **Information Policy &amp;
Analysis**. There are standards that touch on bibliographic information,
indexing, abstracting, controlled vocabularies, and many other library
important issues. If you have not before paid attention to NISO, you might now
start seeing more references to the organization and the standards it
publishes, especially because the international library community has worked
closely with NISO to develop standards for various aspects of library work.

Historical note: As Harris elaborates in the article, NISO came into existence
in the mid-1930s. This was about the same time that Ralph Parker began working
on his punched card system. Not long before this, in the late 1920s, the first
library science graduate program launched at the University of Chicago, and in
the early 1930s, the first research based journal started, *The Library
Quarterly*. We often hear how long libraries have existed, and it's true that
there were quite a few accomplishments before the 1930s, but it is this time
period (for these and a number of other reasons) that marks the modern era of
libraries.

Our additional readings are on TERMS, or Techniques for Electronic Resource
Management. TERMS is not a true standard, but more of a *de facto* standard
that helps outline the electronic resource management work flow. It was
developed in order for librarians or others dealing with electronic resources
to come to a consensus on the processes of electronic resource management.
Version 1 of TERMS is described by the TERMS authors in the *Library Technology
Reports* readings of chapters 1-8. Although it has been replaced by a [newer
version][terms2], it still functions as a thorough introduction to the ERM work flow
and provides guidance and suggestions on all aspects of electronic resource
management. For example, in [chapter 7][chapter_7] of the LTS report on TERMS version
1, the authors provide very helpful information on the importance of working
with providers or vendors in case of cancellation of a resource. They write:

> Do not burn any bridges! Many resources have postcancellation access, which
> means you need to keep up a working relationship with suppliers; this might
> also incur a platform access fee going forward, so this needs to be budgeted
> for in future years. Review the license to fully understand what your
> postcancellation rights to access may be. In addition, you may resubscribe to
> the resources in future years. Content is bought and sold by publishers and
> vendors. Therefore, you may end up back with your original vendor a year or
> two down the line!

Some of this material is repeated in version 2 of TERMS, but version 2 was
created in order to address changes in the world and to include more input from
the community. Version 2 also includes a slightly modified outline, and
[includes the following parts][terms_v2]:

1. Investigating new content for purchase or addition
2. Acquiring new content
3. Implementation
4. Ongoing evaluation and access, and annual review
5. Cancellation and replacement review
6. Preservation

At the same link just provided, they also write about this new version:

> In addition to the works mentioned or cited in the original TERMS report,
> much has been written in the past few years that can help the overwhelmed or
> incoming electronic resources librarian manage their daily workflow. In the
> end, however, most of the challenges facing the management of electronic
> resources is directly related to workflow management. How we manage these
> challenging or complex resources is more important than what we do, because
> how we do it informs how successful and how meaningful the work is, and how
> well it completes our goal of getting access to patrons who want to use these
> resources.

As such, the outline and the content described in these two versions of TERMS
is very much centered on the ERM work flow. Thus, TERMS is essentially a guide
and framework for thinking on the different aspects of the electronic resource
life-cycle within the library, and helps provide librarians with a set of
questions and points of investigation. For example, let's consider Term item 1,
which is to investigate new content for purchase or addition. In a presentation
by the [Emery and Stone (2014)][emery], they suggest that this involves the
following steps, partly paraphrased:

- outline what you want to achieve
- create a specification document
- assemble the right team
- review the market and literature and set up trial
- speak with suppliers and vendors
- make a decision (Emery and Stone, slide 12, 2014)

Emery and Stone provide other examples, and the TERMS listed in this slide are
from the first version. TERM 6, PRESERVATION, was added in version 2, and TERMS
4 and 5 from version 1 were joined together. There is a link to these
[slides][emery], with further examples, in the transcript of this lecture, as well
as the citation.

This week you have a two part exercise: first, you will visit the NISO website
and search for documentation on a standard, recommended practices, or technical
reports and post about it. The differences between these publications follows:

**Technical reports:**

> NISO Technical Reports provide useful information about a particular topic,
> but do not make specific recommendations about practices to follow. They are
> thus "descriptive" rather than "prescriptive" in nature. Proposed standards
> that do not result in consensus may get published as technical reports.

**Recommended Practices:**

> NISO Recommended Practices are "best practices" or "guidelines" for methods,
> materials, or practices in order to give guidance to the user. These
> documents usually represent a leading edge, exceptional model, or proven
> industry practice. All elements of Recommended Practices are discretionary
> and may be used as stated or modified by the user to meet specific needs. 

And **Published and Approved NISO Standards** are the final, approved
definitions that have been achieved by a consensus of the community.

See [https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2014/03/state-standards][state]

Second, after reading about TERMS, try to place these TERMS in additional
electronic resource management context. Please draw from your experience last
week using the ILS and ERM software, from the readings, your personal work
experience in a library, if you have that, or use your imagination.

I am requiring a lot of reading this week because these readings capture the
specifics of the ERM work flow, and understanding them will help you get
started and attain success in this position. The Rinck article is a good
interview with the authors of TERMS. Consider this optional reading, but its
still worthy of your time.
