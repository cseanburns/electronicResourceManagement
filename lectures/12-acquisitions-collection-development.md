## Acquisitions and Collections Development

Hi Class. I've asked you to read a lot this week simply because collection
development and acquisitions is a complex problem for electronic resources.
Again, in the print-only days, acquiring resources was a fairly linear process.
Librarians became aware of an item, sought out reviews of the item, perhaps
collected it, described it, and then shelved it. And perhaps, depending on the
type of the library, weeded it out of the collection at some point down the
line. But there are so many more vectors to be aware of with electronic media.
Not only do libraries not necessarily own digital works (they may), but
different subscription services require different kinds of contracts. The media
(ebooks, journal articles, etc.) require handling and disseminating in
different ways due to not just technological barriers but also because of
licensing barriers. And so forth. Martin et al. (2009) really nail the issue
down in their article this week when they write, on page 216, that:

> As much as we would like to think our primary concerns about collecting are
> based on content, not format, e-resources have certainly challenged many
> long-established notions of how we buy, collect, preserve, and provide access
> to information (p. 217).

Although a world where the format dictates so much makes an interesting world,
it's also problematic and can be worrisome. We do think that content should be
king, but what we also have to ask, how can format either prevent or facilitate
access? If you catch the implicit there, you can see that we're building
a thread between acquisitions, collections development, and usability, which
we'll come to later in the semester.

One thing about this week: in a collection development course, you would
definitely focus on content and on what it takes to create a collection
development policy. Those things are relevant to the acquisition and collection
of e-resources. However, in a major way, one of the things you should take away
from this week's reading is how much the management of electronic resources
have impacted librarian work flows and how that has shaped, or reshaped, have
library organizational hierarchy. I'll provide an organizational chart for you
to discuss, and we'll use it to talk about how much electronic resources have
shaped the organizational structure of the library.

Also, the Lamothe (2015) article is interesting in a different way. Lamothe
finds that if an electronic e-reference source is collected and continually
updated, then it gets continually used, but if it's a static e-electronic
resource (compare, e.g., to a resource pushed out in PDF, although it could be
in HTML), then usage declines. I think additional studies should pursue this
line of questioning, but it raises really interesting questions about the
expectations that our patrons have about our content.

Finally, and this is really big right now, but the Open Educational Resources
issue is major. Textbook prices, as the article by England et al. (2017) notes,
have skyrocketed in recent decades. Some textbooks cost hundreds of dollars,
and of course, the problem impacts both school and academic libraries. UK
Libraries has a nice page on Open Educational Resources. I'll provide a link to
it here in the transcript and in the discussion prompt, and that page links to
OER content for both types of libraries, including the oercommons.org. Explore
this information, and discuss whether libraries ought to collect and acquire
these resources (e.g., by adding records to them in their online public access
catalogs), or should they not be involved at all?
