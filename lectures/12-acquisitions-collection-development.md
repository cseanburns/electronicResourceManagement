# Lecture 12: Acquisitions and Collections Development

Class, this week we discuss aspects of collection development and acquisitions,
which is a complex problem for electronic resources. To rehash, in the
print-only days, acquiring resources was a *more-than-it-is-now* linear
process. Librarians became aware of an item, sought reviews of the item,
possibly collected the item, described it, and then shelved it. And maybe,
depending on the type of the library, weeded it from the collection at some
point in the years to come during their regular course of collection
assessment.

There are many additional vectors to be aware of with electronic resources.
First, libraries may or may not necessarily own digital works, but different
subscription services require different kinds of contracts, as we have learned.
Second, electronic resources (ebooks, journal articles, databases, etc.)
require different handling and disseminating processes due to technological and
licensing barriers. Martin et al. (2009) truly nail the issue in their article
this week where they write that:

> As much as we would like to think our primary concerns about collecting are
> based on content, not format, e-resources have certainly challenged many
> long-established notions of how we buy, collect, preserve, and provide access
> to information (p. 217).

Although a world where the format dictates so much makes an intriguing world,
it's problematic and worrisome. We think that content should be king, but we
must ask, how does format either prevent or facilitate access? If you catch the
implicit gotcha there, you can see that we're building a thread between
acquisitions, collections development, and usability, which we'll learn more
about latter in the semester.

One thing about this week: in a collection development course, you would
unquestionably focus on content and on the work that is involved creating
a collection development policy, which I'll briefly discuss soon. Those things
are relevant to the acquisition and collection of e-resources. However, in
a major way, one of the things you should take away from this week's reading is
how much the management of electronic resources have impacted librarian work
flows and how that has shaped, or reshaped, library organizational hierarchy.
I'll provide an organizational chart for you to discuss, and we'll use it to
discuss how electronic resources have shaped the organizational structure of
the library.

The Lamothe (2015) article is good in a different way. Lamothe finds that if an
electronic e-reference source is collected and perpetually updated, then it
gets continually used. If it's a static e-resource (compare, e.g., to
a resource pushed out in PDF, although it could be in HTML), then usage
declines. I hope additional studies pursue this line of questioning because it
raises questions about the expectations that our patrons have about our
content---perhaps something about how *fresh* they expect that content should
be, where such an expectation may have existed in different shape in prior
years. It also suggests that a resource like Wikipedia has an advantage, since
much of Wikipedia is regularly updated.

Lastly, the Open Educational Resources (OER) issue is a hot topic these days.
Textbook prices, as the article by England et al. (2017) notes, have
skyrocketed in recent decades. Some textbooks cost hundreds of dollars, and the
problem impacts both school and academic libraries. UK Libraries has a helpful
page about Open Educational Resources. I'll provide a link here in the
transcript and in the discussion prompt, and that page links to OER content for
both types of libraries, including the [oercommons.org][oer2]. Explore this
information, and discuss whether libraries ought to collect and acquire these
resources (e.g., by adding records to them in their online public access
catalogs), or should they not be involved at all? This seems like a *duh* kind
of question, but libraries, public or academic, have not traditionally
collected textbooks. Does this change the game for them as educational
institutions?

A quick note about the organizational charts. The chart that I created was
based on my readings of librarian departmental reports written during the late
1950s and early 1960s by librarians at UK. These reports are held at the
University of Kentucky's [Special Collections Research Center][spec_coll], which is
fortunately in the building next to mine on campus. Organizational charts have
been around since the 1800s, but I am not sure when libraries started to create
and use them, and I didn't see one in my research on the history of UK
Libraries for this time period. Thus, I inferred the organizational structure
based on the detailed reports written by the various department heads in the
library. When you compare my chart based on the past to the current one
provided by UK Libraries, I think you'll be intrigued by how much more
complicated the current chart is today. The growth in electronic resources and
technologies do not explain all of this complexity: Knowledge has become more
specialized, and library structure will reflect that; the student population
has grown considerably since then, in size and heterogeneity, and library
structure will reflect that; and the theory and praxis of library management
has evolved throughout the decades, and library structure will reflect that,
too. Other issues are at play, but I do think that technology and e-resources
accounts for a large portion of what we see here, and I'm looking forward to
reading what you have to say about this.

Finally, I'd be guilty of a serious wrongdoing if I did not discuss the
importance of having a collection development policy (CDP) and using that
policy to guide the collection, acquisition, and assessment of electronic
resources. Unfortunately, not all libraries, even at major institutions, create
or use a CDP, and if you end up working at one, then I'd highly encourage you
to convince your colleagues of its importance. A CDP should define
a collection, and then include most if not all of the following topics:

  - mission, vision, and values statement
  - purpose of CDP statement (scope may be included here)
  - selection criteria: this could be general but it could also include
    subsections that focus on specific populations, genres, resource types, and more
  - assessment and maintenance criteria 
  - challenged materials criteria (esp important at public, K-12 libraries)
  - weeding and/or replacement criteria

Included in this transcript are links to two policies, one from the [University
of Maryland][er_policy] and one from the [Lexington Public
Library][lexpub_policy]. The Maryland CDP is not their main one but is
a sub-CDP that focuses on electronic resources. The LPL policy is the main one
for them, and although it does not include a long discussion of electronic
resources, they are mentioned in the policy. Neither approach is wrong but are
catered to the specific libraries and their purposes, communities, and vision
statements. I would like you to search on the web for more and to read through
ones you find for how they discuss electronic resources.
