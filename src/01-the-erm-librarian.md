# The ERM Librarian

## Introduction

In this section, I will:

- provide examples of electronic resources,
- frame the topic of this course, and
- discuss the readings.

## Examples

This semester we're learning about electronic resources
and about how to manage them.
We begin by outlining the kinds of things
that are electronic resources.
[Karin Wikoff][wikoff2011] (2011) outlines the major categories,
and these include:

* **databases**
  * **A&I databases** (abstracting and indexing)
  * **bibliographic databases** full text databases
  * **journal collections**
    * Project Muse
    * JSTOR
  * **specialized and hybrid databases**
    * chemical databases: e.g., [Pubchem][pubchem]
    * genetic databases: e.g.,  [GenBank][genbank]
    * stock databases: e.g., [Nasdaq][nasdaq]
  * **primary source databases**
    * original newspapers: e.g., [Chronicling America][caLOC] 
    * oral histories: e.g., [Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History][nunn] 
* ejournals
* ebooks (see note below)
* linking technologies: e.g., technologies that embed metadata in URLs and send
  across networks:
    * Z39.50
    * OpenURL
    * Federated search

> Ebooks: The technology is rather complicated and
> differentiated depending on the copyright status,
> the file type (PDF, ePUB, TXT, etc.),
> the purpose or genre
> (textbook, fiction or non-fiction, etc.).
> In some  cases, ebooks are software applications and
> not just plain or marked up text, and
> they also vary by platform or
> the application interacting with the text,
> which offer different types of functionality.

Linking technologies allow users
to begin in one search system,
like an OPAC, and
extend a query to other systems
without initiating searches in those other systems.
For example, a user begins a search on WorldCat.org and
finds a book that's available at a nearby library.
The  user only needs to click on the local library link and
be transferred to that library's OPAC.
If that works (it doesn't always),
then the user may submit a request to pick up the book.
That involves additional actions,
including  logging into the user's library account. 

## Framing

As you surmise from the above list,
electronic resources are a major part of any library,
whether academic, public, school, or special.
The need to manage them and
incorporate the management of them
into a library work flow requires
attending to many parts of a big system.
This will be much of what we'll discuss and
learn about this semester.
It will get complicated.
The print only era of libraries
was difficult enough for many reasons, but
managing print and using print resources
was comparably a more linear process.
Electronic resources have raised the stakes
That might be expected:
civilizations had 500 years
to develop and solve print technology,
yet we have had only about three  or so decades of
experience with digital technology.
We are a long way off from stability, and
many of the challenges and frustrations
ahead of us are not simply technical but
also social and legal.

## Our Readings: The nature of ERM librarianship

Our readings this week provide
introductions to electronic resource librarianship
and help frame this course.

### A Specialist and A Generalist

The first article by [Stachokas][stachokas2018] (2018)
surveys the history of this specialist/generalist librarian role.
Stachokas (2018) finds that
the electronic resource librarian has their feet
planted in technical services and collection development,
that this requires a holistic understanding of the 
electronic resource work flow,
of its embeddedness in the scholarly and library ecosystem, and
that this division is leading to different areas of specialization:
those who focus on
"licensing, acquisitions, and collection development" (p. 15),
and those who focus on
"metadata, discovery, management of knowledge bases, and
addressing technical problems" (p. 15).
This rings true to me.
In my own observations,
I've noticed that job announcements have increasingly stressed
one of the above areas and not both.

### The Technical Communicator as the "Bridge"

In the second article,
[Hulseberg][hulseberg2016] (2016) uses
the field of technical communication (TC)
to interpret the field of electronic resource librarianship.
Hulseberg (2016) takes the view that an
electronic resource librarian is, among other things,
a technical communicator.
This is much different from being
someone who helps patrons with their technical problems.
Rather, this is someone who completes advanced work in
documenting and reporting technical processes.

Hulseberg (2016) highlights four important themes about ERM:
the interesting themes to me are
*Theme one: Metaphors of "bridge" and "translator"*, and
*Theme Two: Collaborating in a web of relationships*.
When I was an undergraduate,
I imagined the job that I wanted
would be one involving connecting people in different silos
to each other by helping them communicate with each other.
It turns out that,
under Hulseberg's (2016) view,
electronic resource librarianship does this work.
However, the other themes are just as important, and
in particular, Theme Four, about jurisdiction,
highlights one of the major disruptive acts on librarianship
in the last thirty or forty years.

Consider that most people, researchers and scholars included,
use non-library provided resources to locate information.
Additionally, more works, scholarly and non-scholarly,
are freely and publicly available on the web,
e.g., as [open access (OA)][oa].
This means that the library
is becoming disintermediated
as a result of people using sites non-library services,
like Google or Google Scholar,
to retrieve freely available works on the web,
instead of at the library.
As a result, what becomes of the core jurisdiction of the librarian?
And of the electronic resource librarian, in particular?
In concrete terms: a [recent paper][klitzing2019] (Klitzing, 2019)
reported that researchers state they use
Google Scholar 83% of the time and
EBSCOhost 29% of the time to find relevant material.
That raises strategic and technical questions about the today's role
of the librarian and library in the scholarly communication system.

### To License or Not To License

The third article, by [Zhu][zhu2016] (2016),
places a different theoretical lens
on what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.
Zhu (2016) posits that the licensing aspect of
electronic resource management significantly influenced
ER librarianship identity.
One reason why Zhu's (2016) findings are insightful is
due to the fact that we often license electronic resources
rather than buy them.
Copyright law, historically, has provided librarians
with their most important legal justification
for collecting and lending works:
the [First Sale Doctrine][copyrightsearch].
Copyright law provides copyright owners with the
right to distribute their work, but
the first sale doctrine holds that if you buy a book,
then you have a right to lend or sell your copy.
This doctrine is fundamental to librarianship but
also raises problems today since most digital works
(ebooks, etc)
are licensed and not bought by libraries.

Stachokas (2018), Hulseberg (2016), and Zhu (2016)
present the historical and environmental forces
that have shaped the work of electronic resource librarians and
their professional identities, and
each of these authors discuss important themes
that function as evidence of these identities.
In our discussions this week,
we should focus on these themes and
how you make sense of it all.

## Conclusion

Electronic resource librarianship is one of the
most fascinating areas of librarianship to me.
Because digital technologies have woven their way
into all parts of the contemporary library ecosystem,
and because these digital technologies bring with them
a slew of legal and social challenges,
electronic resource librarians have had,
as these technologies have developed,
to maintain a holistic view of this ecosystem just
as they have had to specialize in key areas that
require maintaining that holistic, interconnected view.

The course takes that holistic view and
divides it into four parts for study.
In the first part,
we will continue to study the nature of the work itself:
of what it means to be an electronic resource librarian.

In the second part, we will learn about the technologies
that an electronic resource librarian uses and
the conditions that shape these technologies.
We will learn about integrated library systems (ILS) and
how these systems conform (or not) to standards,
how they foster or obstruct 
interoperability and electronic access.

In the third part, we focus on processes and their contexts.
We will study the electronic resource librarian's workflow,
the economics and the markets of electronic resources,
what is involved in licensing these resources and
negotiating with vendors.

At the end, we will focus on patrons and end users;
that is, those we serve. 
Because electronic resources are digital,
usage of them leaves behind traces of that usage.
This means we will study how that usage is measured and
what those measurements can validly say.
Electronic resources means having to use websites, and
thus we will study how electronic resource librarians
are involved in user experience studies.
Because usage leaves traces of personal information,
we will end this course on topics related to the
security of these resources and the privacy of those
who use them.

## Discussion Questions

As we start to address all of this, I want us to consider two questions:

1. How do we manage all of this electronic stuff? Not only does it include
   complicated technology and has an impact on our patrons, but it involves of
   different sorts of librarians.
1. What exactly is an electronic resource librarian? I like this basic question
   because, due to perhaps representations in the media (movies, TV shows,
   books) and the interactions we've had with librarians in our lifetimes, we
   all have pretty well-defined, whether accurate, images of what reference or
   cataloging librarians are. But what about an electronic resource librarian?
   This is something different, right? And it's not likely to be a position
   that's ever really captured and presented publicly.
