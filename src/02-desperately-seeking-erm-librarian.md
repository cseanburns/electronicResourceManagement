# Desperately Seeking an ERM Librarian

## Introduction

Class, in this section, I will:

- frame the readings
- discuss the readings, and
- list some questions to guide our discussion for the week.

Our goal in this section is
to understand how the job of
electronic resource management (ERM)
has changed throughout the years and
to develop some ideas about where it is headed.

### Framing

This week we read two articles
([Hartnett, 2014][hartnett2014], [Murdock, 2010][murdock2010])
that analyze electronic resource librarian job advertisements.
Additionally, the reading list includes
the NASIG core competencies
for electronic resource librarianship.
I suggest that you review the list of core competencies
before you read the articles.

These articles are of interest since
they capture a description of electronic resource librarianship
in earlier years.
There are many social, political, and economic conditions that
have stayed about the same since these articles were published,
and these conditions help fixate the work of the ERM librarian,
but constant changes in technologies and types of electronic resources
have meant that electronic resource librarians are
constantly adapting to new work flows.
Our Murdoch (2010) reading makes this point.

Though the technology differs,
the descriptions and duties of ER jobs are still
on the mark in many ways.
I posted links to job announcements
in the discussion forum to demonstrate this.
Most of those job announcements
were emailed to the [SERIALST][serialst]
email list (please subscribe to it) and
are not current job openings, but
they were current within the last few years.

To follow up on more current advertisements for ER librarians,
I did a Google search on August 15, 2022 using the following query:

```
"electronic resource librarian" job
```

Results are consistent with past qualifications listed in the links
mentioned above and
with the [last section's](01-the-erm-librarian.html) discussions
on the nature of ERM librarianship.
I will withhold linking to these advertisements since I don't expect
the links to persist as the positions get filled.
But several sources outline the following requested qualifications, and
I think the **themes** from the prior section come through
in this list:

- provide "consistent and reliable access to the Library's electronic resources
  and establishing workflows that maintain discovery and use of all Library
  collections"
- analyze "feasibility of technical platforms"
- "resource licensing and contracting"
- "copyright compliance"
- "vendor negotiations"
- "Acts as a bridge across multiple Library units"
- enhance "access and use"
- design a "system of access"
- analyze "staff and user issues with discovery of resources"
- coordinate "system administration responsibilities for integrated library
  system (Ex Libris Alma/Primo VE) with Technical Services Librarian"
- "create reports in Alma and individual databases as needed, including but not
  limited to usage statistics, user experience statistics, collection analysis
  and overlap"
- monitor "listservs for Alma and Primo VE"
- manage "administrative and troubleshooting functions for EZ Proxy and
  e-resource vendors for access and authentication"
- evaluate "the scope and quality of research resources available"
- "reviews and negotiates licenses for [...] purchased resources and manages the
  acquisition, activation, and troubleshooting of all purchased and subscribed
  electronic resources for the Library."
- gathers and analyzes "serials, e-books, database usage, and other related
  assessment data"
- oversees "the activities of the serials acquisitions unit"
- maintain "responsibility for licensing and the management of electronic
  information resources [...] as well as the shared consortial resources"
- assist in "planning and developing policies and workflows"
- partner "with the Acquisitions Librarian and staff on the ordering and payment
  activity of electronic resources"
- establish and "documents library procedures and best practices for the
  acquisition, licensing, implementation, assessment, and budgeting of
  electronic resources"
- work "with colleagues [...] to optimize resource discovery"
- work "with vendors to resolve technical issues and manages EZproxy for remote
  access"
- "collects, analyzes, and presents use, purchase, and availability data of
  electronic resources"
- "works collaboratively to support metadata maintenance for electronic
  resources and both print and digital serials"
- develop and implement "submissions to a shared University institutional
  repository"
- works "under the supervision of the Associate Director for Technical Services"

To stay current about the position overall and
about the specific duties involved,
I encourage you to bookmark and
stay abreast of relevant journals in the area.
In addition to the two publication titles used in this
section's readings
and to the SERIALST list I have asked you to subscribe to,
I recommend that you bookmark relevant journals, like the
[Journal of Electronic Resources Librarianship][JERL],
[Against the Grain][atg], and
[Journal of Electronic Resources in Medical Libraries][jerml]

### Our Readings

Now let's start with Murdock's (2010) overview of the
electronic resource librarian's position
in the first decade of this century, and
proceed to Harnett's (2014) work that describes the
electronic resource librarian's duties around ten years ago.
NASIG's core competencies were also published around ten years ago
and have only received minor revisions since then.
We conclude by considering the current job advertisements
listed above and elsewhere.
With these,
our goal in this section is to get a sense of the
electronic resource librarian's job duties and
available technologies
from the earlier part of this century to now;
to understand where it was, how it has evolved,
and where it might be headed.
Overall, you will get a sense of just how much
this position has changed in the intervening years,
what I refer to as **constant disruption** in the next section.

One of the useful aspects of Murdock's (2010) article
is in section 4.3,
which lists a 'timeline of commercial ERM developments and standards.'
These technologies and standards
continue today,
and have, via hindsight,
strongly shaped how electronic resources currently work.
This timeline includes what's now referred to
as the A-Z list of serials,
which started in 2000,
OpenURL linking technology from 2001,
the combining of both integrated library systems (ILS)
and electronic resource management systems (ERMS) in 2004,
federated searching from 2005,
SUSHI usage statistics protocol from 2006,
and SERU from 2007.
We will explore each of these topics in future sections.

Murdock's (2010) analysis shows that some duties
started to wane in the early years.
Website maintenance and deployment (see Fig 13),
for example,
completely dropped off the radar.
This was likely due to the development of
content management systems,
i.e., turnkey website solutions,
that are still in use today.
For example, I remember [Joomla][joomla]
and [Drupal][drupal],
both content management systems that
can work as library websites,
taking off around 2007 to 2009,
around the time that Murdock shows this area of activity declining.

One of Murdock's (2010) conclusions is that
employers sought "to hire those who are able to perform
traditional librarian duties, such as reference and
instructional service, in addition to e-resource specific
tasks" (p. 37).
Based on what we see in job advertisements today,
this seems to be much less the case as
electronic resource librarians have become more specialized,
as the position has divided into two areas
(cf., technical services aspect and collection development aspect),
and as electronic resources have grown and become more
dominant in the intervening years.
ER librarians still liaison with their communities but
in different ways (i.e., not as reference librarians).

A big change since 2012,
when Harnett's (2014) research ends,
is that more technology has moved to the cloud.
What this means is that we rely less on onsite servers,
where those servers might be managed by library IT (or other IT).
Switching from local IT infrastructure to
cloud based IT infrastructure
requires different types of technological skills
and suggests that conceptual knowledge
is paramount.
(This is my opinion, but it's based on years of
doing and teaching systems administration work.)
For example, it's more important to have a conceptual understanding
of how metadata works than to know how to use some
piece of software for managing metadata
(aside: however, conceptual and practical knowledge
cannot so easily be divorced from each other).
Metadata standards and schemes change far less often
than the software used to enter or administer metadata.

Cloud-based solutions have changed
the field in other ways.
Hosted software means
the software isn't purchased but leased,
and leasing involves outside vendors
who must have the technological skill sets
and resources to manage and provide the technology.
So we rely, in very important ways, and
are more dependent on other actors in the
publishing and e-resource provider ecosystem.
That involves a lot of trust, and
it involves more negotiations between
librarians and vendors, and
the ability to collaborate and develop good, ethical
relationships.
The kind of work that may increase,
as more software and data are hosted on the cloud,
might be the kind of work that requires strong communication
skills, strong negotiating skills, and
knowledge of how licensing works,
how copyright and contract law work, and
how electronic resource collections work and
inter-operate across platforms.
However, again, this can be complicated.
A couple of years ago there was an email
on the SERIALST listserv
by a librarian that asked whether librarians
have retained powers to negotiate and sign contracts.
The responses were mixed.
Some librarians had the jurisdiction but
many had lost it, per the email responses.
Even under this scenario, though,
technological understanding is necessary
in order to negotiate the best deal
for a library's stakeholders and
to acquire the best and
most seamless product needed by library users.

Even though IT continues to be outsourced,
this doesn't mean that we become lax
in our understanding of how the technology works;
just as we can't become lax in how librarianship
works even though librarians answer fewer reference questions
than they did in previous years
(i.e., you still need to know how to respond
systematically and thoroughly
to research and reference questions).
What I mean is that,
in order to communicate this topic well,
to negotiate well, and
to sign licenses that are beneficial to our communities,
it helps to understand and
be adept at the tech so that
we are not bamboozled in those negotiations.
Also, if something goes wrong,
e.g., with the link resolver technology,
we have to learn how to identify the problem;
that is, whether the technological issue
is the link resolver technology and not something else,
like the OPAC technology.

## Conclusion

I want you to think about these
job advertisement studies in relation
to what you are learning about electronic resources
as well as in relation to the kinds of advertisements
you've seen since whenever you started paying attention to them,
like those outlined at the beginning of this section.
In essence, think about where you see yourself
in these advertisements and how they impact you.

Although it might be the case that most of you
haven't had a chance to learn electronic resource back ends,
that doesn't disqualify you from attempts
to start reflecting on this part of librarianship.
As library users of these technologies,
you have gathered enough abstract and practical knowledge
to know enough.

### Questions for Discussion

We'll soon move away from reflective questions and
get our hands dirty with specific technologies, licensing, etc.,
but for now let's reflect on the following questions:

- Where do you think you stand in comparison to ERM job ads and to [NASIG Core
  Competencies][NCC]?
  - Where are you strong?
  - Where would you like to improve?
- What can you (and we, as a course community) do to help each of you get there?
  - What's your path?
  - What can you practice?
