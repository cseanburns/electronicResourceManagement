# Licensing and Negotiating

## Introduction

Now that we know the basic
structure and contents of
a license for electronic resources,
we can discuss the negotiation process.

We know that because of
projects like SERU,
some licensing may be avoided,
and projects like LIBLICENSE will
help streamline the process
because they provide helpful boilerplate.
When we enter negotiations for some products,
especially big ticket products,
it's helpful to know what
that process might look like, and
of course,
how to go about it.

## Principled Negotiation

[Abbie Brown (2014)][brown2014] offers a
number of great tips in her talk, and
I want to highlight a few things.

First, her discussion of
**principled negotiation** and
**assertive communication** is important.
Principled negotiation is about
keeping negotiations professional,
even when it feels personal or
when something triggers our anger
in the licensing process.
Before you enter negotiations,
keep in mind the objective you
want to attain; and
use reason, creativity, and
problem solving skills to get there.

## Assertive Communication

Assertive communication is
being willing to express yourself.
This is not the same as
being aggressive, which
is not warranted.
Brown's (2014) suggestion
to have other people look
at your emails,
that might have been
written in anger,
before sending is golden.

## Stereotypes

Brown (2014) also discusses,
based on her experience,
some stereotypes that get in the
way of negotiating.
These include:

* Librarian stereotypes
* Library stereotypes
* Vendors stereotypes:

Stereotypes, from either direction,
should be avoided.
People exist on each side of the
table, and although each
side has their own self-interests,
stereotypes prevent connection.
And reflecting on any stereotypes
we have also reduces anxiety in 
the negotiation process.

## Community

As a negotiator,
Brown (2014) described having
to work with lots of people,
of having to negotiate with
people in her own library.
This is a great insight.
It's very important to
talk through things
with colleagues and vendors.

## Put it in Writing

Brown's (2014) point about
putting things in writing
will help you.
You want to write write well
and succinctly,
but if it's in writing,
then it's documented and
can be easily archived and retrieved.

## Negotiation Workflows

[Smith and Hartnett (2015)][smith2015]
provide a real world example
of the negotiating process
that includes a work flow
around licensing.
Remember, document everything and
revisit your documentation.
Importantly, use that documentation
to formalize checklists.
Having a workflow in place
around licensing will help
make your work more efficient
and help ensure that
all bases are covered.

[Dygert and Barrett (2016)][dygert2016]
cover the specifics of licensing:
what to look for,
what shouldn't be given away,
how to negotiate principally,
and more.
Likewise, [Dunie (2015)][dunie2015]
gets into the specifics
of the negotiation process,
which includes definitions of
terms, business models, and strategies.

## Conclusion

Becoming a skillful negotiator
takes practice, but this
section will help prepare you
to prepare for the process.
The main point I want to make
is this:
if you find yourself in a
position where one
of your job responsibilities
is to negotiate with vendors for e-resources
(or for anything else),
then come back to these
sources of information and
spend additional time studying
them and taking notes on them.
Sources like these, and
others like them,
such as those listed by
[Garofalo (2017)][garofalo2017],
in the literature,
will prepare you if you study them.
Being prepared is the
most important step.
