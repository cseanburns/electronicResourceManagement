# Licensing Basics

## Introduction

I think it's fair to say
that what characterizes
electronic resource management the most
is licensing.
For if something is licensed,
then it's most likely e-content or related,
and by definition, it's not owned by a library,
and thus it's a *temporary* item in the collection,
and thus requires special management.

Licensing requires understanding other
aspects of electronic resource management, too.
While an ERM librarian's job duties might
be solely focused on the technical aspects
of the work,
i.e., those things we covered in prior sections,
an ERM librarian whose primary job
duty is to participate in the
licensing process must have a good grasp
of the technical for no reason
other than that it is the technical
that is licensed.
In other words,
it's probably a good thing
to understand what is being licensed.
Thus, this is why we spent time
on the technical aspects
before working on licensing.

Before we get into licensing,
we should refresh ourselves
on the basics of copyright law,
since what is being licensed is a
fact of its existence.
We should also know something about
contract law, and
how the two types of laws are related,
since licensing entails negotiating,
signing, and managing contracts.

## Copyright and Contracts

There is a complicated tension 
between [copyright law][copyrightgov] and
[contract law][contractlaw].
In short, copyright is
a temporary [*right*][whatiscopyright] because
of its close connection to the concept
of the [public domain][publicdomain].
In the US, copyright was established in
the Constitution under
[Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8][a1s8c8],
which states:

> [The Congress shall have Power ...] To
> promote the Progress of Science and useful
> Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors
> and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
> respective Writings and Discoveries.

The clause in the U.S. Constitution
grants copyright holders specific,
exclusive rights,
which inherently creates a tension
between public and private interests.
On one hand,
these exclusive rights operate
much like private property,
allowing copyright owners to control
the use of their creations and
even transfer or sell these
rights through contracts,
which are in personam by nature (Rub, 2017).
On the other hand,
these rights are not absolute;
they are granted for a "limited time" and
with the ultimate aim of serving the
public interest by enriching the
cultural and intellectual commons.

This dual nature of copyright--its
function as a form of private property
that can be transacted, and
its overarching goal to
promote public welfare--adds layers
of complexity to its legal treatment.
While copyright law grants
certain exclusive rights
that can be enforced against
individuals through **in personam** legal actions,
these rights are also designed to be
temporary and ultimately benefit the public.
Therefore, copyright exists as both a
personal right that can be legally
enforced against specific individuals and
a mechanism intended to
serve broader societal goals.

> *in personam*: made against or affecting
> a specific person only;
> imposing a personal liability (Google Dictionary).

In short, copyright exists in a unique space
where it functions as a basic right,
embedded in the earliest part of the
US Constitution;
it exists as a temporary bulwark
against public ownership for
the public good;
and unlike other, basic rights,
copyright is transferable,
since it is a type of property right.

> Copyright is a type of economic right. However, other types of *rights*
> cannot be treated as property. These include natural rights (life, liberty,
> and the pursuit of happiness), civil rights (right to vote, right to a fair
> trial, protections against discrimination), political rights (right to
> protest, run for public office), and social rights (right to healthcare,
> education, and housing).

This all gets more complicated when
licensing enters the picture, and
this largely has to do with three things.
First, the history of software
reflects the history of print,
in as much as source code relied
on a physical medium,
like a floppy disk or magnetic tape,
to be distributed,
just as a book had to be printed
to be distributed.
Second, the internet and greater
availability of higher bandwidth speeds
enabled, like books, software to
be distributed as easily as any
other digital object.
Third, it wasn't originally
clear that software, or source code
in particular, was copyrightable,
but the Copyright Office at the
Library of Congress eventually
decided that it was eligible.
This eligibility became codified
in an 1980 amendment to
the 1976 Copyright Act.
This cemented the ability for 
software copyright owners to lease
their source code,
especially once that code was
free of a physical expression,
and thereby evade the First Sale Doctrine,
to users without transferring ownership
of the expression to users.

## Licensing Agreements

[Licensing agreements][licensingagreements]
offer copyright or intellectual property
(patents, trademarks)
owners a contractual framework.
This framework functions as an
agreement among two or more parties.
It enables the parties involved
to participate,
within some range of time
(all contracts must have
start and end dates),
in an owner's intellectual property
under certain conditions.
Librarians enter into licensing
agreements of all sorts.
Licenses cover bibliographic databases,
ILS/ERM software, and
of course, e-content.

Entering a licensing agreement for
e-content means that libraries
do not own that content but
only have access for a limited period of time,
as defined in the contract.
This is unlike print works,
which fall under the first-sale doctrine.
The existence of a licensing agreement
between a library and an
intellectual property owner
thus entails lack of
ownership of the *item*
(think of item as defined by the
*Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records*
[FRBR][frbr] model).

## Licenses

Weir (2016) provides a nice outline
of licenses and what they include.
According to Weir,
there are two general types
of licensing agreements:

* **End user agreements**: these are generally the kind that people
  accept when they use some kind of software or some service.
* **Site agreements**: these are the agreements librarians get involved
  in when they negotiate for things like databases. Here, *site* refers
  to the organizational entity.

Licenses must include a variety of components.
Weir (2016) outlines the parts
of a standard license.
They include:

* **Introductions**: this includes information about the licensee and
  the licensor, date information, some information about payments and
  the schedule.
* **Definitions**: this section defines the major terms of the contract.
  Weir includes, as examples, the licensee, the licensor, authorized
  user, user population, and whether the contract entails a single or
  multi-user site.
* **Access**: This covers topics such as IP authentication and proxy
  access.
* **Acceptable use**: Included here are issues related to downloading,
  storage, print rights, interlibrary loan (ILL), and preservation.
* **Prohibited use**: What people cannot do: download restrictions, etc.
* **Responsibilities**: What the licensee's (the library)
  responsibilities are. Be careful about accepting responsibility for
  actions that the library would have a difficult time monitoring. Then
  also, what are the licensor's responsibilities. This might include
  topics such as 24 hour access.
* **Term and terminations**: Details about the terms of the contract and
  how the contract may be terminated. Be aware that many libraries are
  attached to either municipal, county, or state governments and must
  adhere to relevant laws.
* Various provisions

As an example,
the California Digital Library,
via the University of California,
provides a [checklist][checklist]
and a copy of their
standard license agreement.

[checklist]:https://cdlib.org/resources/vendors/license-agreement-checklist/

The checklist covers four
main sections, additional subsections,
and is well worth a read:

* Content and Access
* Licensing
* Business
* Management

> Licenses generally must include a scope (what rights are being granted and
> what limitations exist), a duration (how long the license will last),
> territory (where the license applies), fees or royalties (whether the
> licensee has to pay for the license, and if so, how much), revocation terms
> (under what circumstances the license can be revoked, and warranties and
> liabilities (any guarantees provided by either party and limitations on
> liability).

## Standardizing Agreements

Like the various technologies that
we have covered,
NISO and its members moved toward
forming a document that helps
create a common license framework.
The result was
[SERU: A Shared Electronic Resource Understanding][seru].
Although all licenses share some
basic similarities,
as discussed in Weir (2016) above,
the details of the hundreds of licenses
a large library has to handle
can get lost in a sea of variability.

[SERU is a NISO recommended practice][seruDoc]
helps to resolve this.
It fosters a common approach
to some aspects of the licensing process and
in fact can be used as
"an alternative to a license agreement"
if a provider and a library agrees to use it.
Like the standard licensing structure
that Weir (2016) outlines,
SERU includes parts that
describe use, inappropriate use,
access, and more
but also posits other stipulations,
such as
confidentiality and privacy.

## NASIG Core Competencies

We have addressed the
[NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources Librarians (NCC)][nasigcc]
in earlier sections.
The NCC is a reminder 
of the centrality of licensing
for the ERM librarian.
Section 1.2 states:

> Thorough knowledge of electronic resource licensing and the legal
> framework in which it takes place.  Since licenses govern the use of
> most library electronic resources and have conditions that cannot
> knowingly  be  violated,  an ERL with responsibilities related to
> licensing must demonstrate familiarity with how and for whom an
> organization licenses content, as well as the concepts, implications,
> and contract language pertaining to such issues as archival rights,
> perpetual access and interlibrary loan.  A practical working
> understanding of issues such as copyright and fair use will allow ERLs
> to obtain the least restrictive, most library-friendly licensing terms
> during publisher/vendor license negotiations.

Even though I have covered NCC
in earlier sections,
it's a reminder that when
we talk about electronic resource management,
we talk about a comprehensive
list of responsibilities,
skills, technologies, and more, and
that we should keep this on our radar.
Second, the [Regan (2015)][regan2015]
specifically mentions these competencies
with respect to the importance of
learning more about the licensing process.

I think it's still true,
seven years after publication and
as Regan (2015) states,
that few library schools cover licensing
and license negotiations and
more broadly,
electronic resource management, but
I think that's changing.
Even if it's covered, like here,
Regan's advice is still important and
the essential questions they ask
are relevant even if you have
extensive experience with the process.

What is also relevant is the
additional theme that Regan (2015)
covers about the importance
of advocating.
Many people are nervous about the
idea of having to negotiate a license
for an e-product, but
in reality,
such work is not done outside of a team.
And that team will likely include
people who work outside of libraries.
This makes it important to advocate
for the library and the licensing process.

## LIBLICENSE 

[LIBLICENSE][liblicense] is a resource
to assist librarians in crafting, adopting,
and managing licenses for electronic resources.
The project is aimed at university libraries, but
is relevant to other library types, too.
The [model licenses][addmodels] page provides a link
to the main template, but
also links to additional model licenses
that cover the United States,
the United Kingdom, and Canada
from various institutional perspectives,
including consortial licensing.

The LIBLICENSE model license
includes helpful details,
such as types of authorized uses and
provisions on:

* course reserves
* course packs
* electronic links
* scholarly sharing
* scholarly citation
* text and data mining

It's important to note that anything
that is covered in a license is subject
to negotiation between the library and
the vendor.
That does not meant that terms will
be accepted between the parties, but
if something is unfavorable or not
in the best interests of your institution
and patrons,
then that needs to be discussed by all parties.

These model licenses are invaluable
not only from a practicing perspective but
also from an educational perspective.
The more you review,
the more comfortable you will become
working with them.
And, as we will learn in the next section,
one of the most important parts of the
negotiating process is being prepared
to negotiate.
That entails being familiar with the
basic license model.
