# Licensing Basics

## Introduction

Licenses, licensing, and
negotiating licenses can be
one of the most important parts
electronic resource management.
Due to the significance of
this area of work,
it is only after we
we have learned
about the technical and
the economic aspects of
ERM work that
can begin our coverage of this
important topic.

To start, we should refresh ourselves
on the basics of copyright law,
since what is being licensed is a
fact of its existence.
We should also know something about
contract law, and
how the two types of laws are related,
since licensing entails negotiating,
signing, and managing contracts.

## Copyright and Contracts

There is a complicated tension 
between [copyright law][copyrightgov] and
[contract law][contractlaw].
In short, copyright is
a temporary [*right*][whatiscopyright] because
of its close connection to the concept
of the [public domain][publicdomain].
In the US, copyright was established in
the Constitution under
[Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8][a1s8c8],
which states:

> [The Congress shall have Power ...] To
> promote the Progress of Science and useful
> Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors
> and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
> respective Writings and Discoveries.

My reading of this has been,
and note, this is my reading and
not necessarily legal dogma,
that *respective Writings and Discoveries*
belong to the public;
as such, this clause was articulated
in the Constitution
to carve out some protection space
for the authors or inventors
from the public,
for a limited time,
in order to *promote
the Progress of Science and useful Arts*.
But in the end,
it is the public that is served
and that ultimately owns these creations.

The clause gives copyright owners
a *right*, and as a right,
it takes preemptive status
over other laws that are
less universal,
laws that are *in personam* (Rub, 2017).
What creates tension is that
it is a kind of *right* that can
be transferred or sold by way of a contract;
that is, it is *in personam*.
Under this view,
copyrighted work is property (Rub, 2017),
and as property,
it can be traded for goods
and services.

> *in personam*: made against or affecting
> a specific person only;
> imposing a personal liability (Google Dictionary).

[Licensing agreements][licensingagreements]
offer copyright or intellectual property
owners a contractual framework.
This framework functions as a
contractual agreement among
two or more parties, and
it enables the parties involved
to participate,
within some range of time
(all contracts must have
start and end dates),
in an owner's intellectual property
under certain conditions.
Librarians enter into licensing
agreements of all sorts.
Licences cover bibliographic databases,
ILS/ERM software, and
of course, e-content.
Unfortunately, regarding the latter,
entering a licensing agreement for
e-content means that libraries
do not own that content but
only have access for a limited period of time,
as defined in the contract.
This is unlike print works,
which fall under the first-sale doctrine.
The existence of a licensing agreement
between a library and an
intellectual property owner
thus entails lack of
ownership of the *item*
(think of item as defined by the
*Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records*
[FRBR][frbr] model).

## About Licenses

Weir (2016) provides a nice outline
licenses and what they include.
According to Weir,
there are two general types
of licensing agreements:

* **End user agreements**: these are generally the kind that people
  accept when they use some kind of software or some service.
* **Site agreements**: these are the agreements librarians get involved
  in when they negotiate for things like databases. Here, *site* refers
  to the organizational entity.

Licenses must include a variety of components.
Weir (2016) outlines the parts
of a standard license.
They include:

* **Introductions**: this includes information about the licensee and
  the licensor, date information, some information about payments and
  the schedule.
* **Definitions**: this section defines the major terms of the contract.
  Weir includes, as examples, the licensee, the licensor, authorized
  user, user population, and whether the contract entails a single or
  multi-user site.
* **Access**: This covers topics such as IP authentication and proxy
  access.
* **Acceptable use**: Included here are issues related to downloading,
  storage, print rights, interlibrary loan (ILL), and preservation.
* **Prohibited use**: What people cannot do: download restrictions, etc.
* **Responsibilities**: What the licensee's (the library)
  responsibilities are. Be careful about accepting responsibility for
  actions that the library would have a difficult time monitoring. Then
  also, what are the licensor's responsibilities. This might include
  topics such as 24 hour access.
* **Term and terminations**: Details about the terms of the contract and
  how the contract may be terminated. Be aware that many libraries are
  attached to either municipal, county, or state governments and must
  adhere to relevant laws.
* Various provisions

As an example,
the California Digital Library,
via the University of California,
provides a [checklist][checklist]
and a copy of their
standard license agreement.

[checklist]:https://cdlib.org/resources/vendors/license-agreement-checklist/

The checklist covers four
main sections, additional subsections,
and is well worth a read:

* Content and Access
* Licensing
* Business
* Management

We have three additional readings this week. One of the readings covers SERU: A
Shared Electronic Resource Understanding, by NISO. We also have a short article
by Regan that provides some guidelines on becoming competent on licensing.

[SERU][seru2], [Shared Electronic Resource Understanding][seru3], is a NISO
collaborative document that helped standardize some aspects of the licensing
process and can be used as "an alternative to a license agreement" if a
provider and a library agrees to use it. Like the standard licensing structure
that Weir (2016) outlines, SERU includes parts that describe use, inappropriate
use, access, and more but also posits other stipulations, such as
confidentiality and privacy.

The other reading is the [NASIG Core Competencies for Electronic Resources
Librarians][nasigcc]. We have already visited this, and although it doesn't
specifically cover licensing, I added it to this week's reading list for a
couple of reasons. First, it's a reminder that when we talk about electronic
resource management, we talk about a comprehensive list of responsibilities,
skills, technologies, and more, and I need to keep this on our radar. Second,
because the Regan reading specifically mentions these competencies, and I
thought it would good to reintroduce them here.

[nasigcc]:https://www.nasig.org/Core-Competencies

This week, after reading the material, I want you to focus on the Regan article
and some of the questions raised there. Regan raises important questions about
the licensing process, about effective communication, and about advocacy. I
want you to comment on these issues, and I want you to answer some questions
that Regan raises. You can do that by searching the web and library websites.
In fact, at the beginning of the semester I asked you to subscribe to the
SERIALST email list. It's now time to draw upon that and any discussions you've
seen in those lists that are related. You can usually search the archives of
those lists, especially since traffic has been a bit light recently. Regan
mentions some other sources, such as [LIBLICENSE][liblicense] and
[copyrightlaws.com][cclaws]. Any of these are fair game for our discussions,
but the latter is a commercial entity that provides material and tutorials for
a kind of tuition. It might be useful to know about it, but explore only if you
want. However, LIBLICENSE provides model licenses as well as links to
[additional model licences][addmodels], including the above mentioned
California Digital Library Standard License Agreement. The LIBLICENSE model
license includes even more details, such as types of authorized uses, and
details that include provisions on:

* course reserves
* course packs
* electronic links
* scholarly sharing
* scholarly citation
* text and data mining
