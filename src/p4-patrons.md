# Chapter Four: Patrons

The chapter on patrons addresses the critical intersection between users and
electronic resources within libraries. Comprising three main topics, these
sections explore: 1. user experience, which offers an analysis of how patrons
interact with digital materials, emphasizing usability, accessibility, and
satisfaction; 2. the evaluation and management of e-resource usage, which
provides an examination of methods to assess, monitor, and enhance the
utilization of e-resources to help ensure that librarians meet the diverse and
evolving needs of their communities; and 3. security and privacy concerns,
which sheds light on the imperative of safeguarding user information and
privacy in the digital age. This includes considerations related to
authentication, data protection, and ethical handling of personal information.
Together, these lectures reflect a user-centric approach to e-resource
management and serve as an essential guide for ERM librarians committed to
enhancing patron engagement, trust, and satisfaction.
