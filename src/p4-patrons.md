# Chapter Four: Patrons

The chapter on patrons addresses the critical intersection between users and electronic resources within libraries.
These sections explore three main topics:

1. **User experience**, which offers an analysis of how patrons interact with digital materials, emphasizing usability, accessibility, and satisfaction;
2. **The evaluation and measurement of e-resource usage**, which provides an examination of methods to assess, monitor, and enhance the
utilization of e-resources to help ensure that librarians meet the diverse and evolving needs of their communities; and
3. **Security and privacy concerns**, which sheds light on the imperative of safeguarding user information and
privacy in the digital age. This includes considerations related to authentication, data protection, and ethical handling of personal information.

These lectures reflect a user-centric approach to e-resource management, and
they serve as an essential guide for ERM librarians committed to enhancing patron engagement, trust, and satisfaction.
