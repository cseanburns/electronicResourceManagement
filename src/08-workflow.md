# Workflow

## Introduction

If all goes according to plan,
this week's readings
on electronic resource management and
on workflow analysis should
put prior material into context and
act as a bridge to the material
we discuss in the
remaining sections of this work. 

To recap: in the beginning
we learned about:

* what it means to be a librarian who oversees or is a part of electronic
  resource management,
* what kinds of criteria are sought for in new hires, and
* why electronic resources have introduced so much *constant disruption* across
  libraries.

This latter point is largely
due to, among other things,
the fact that the
print-era involved largely
(or at least more so)
a linear process of
collection management
and information use
that was fundamentally altered
with the introduction of
electronic resources.

Then we learned
about the functions and
modules offered by:

* electronic resource management software and
* integrated library system software. 

To understand those
systems better,
we learned about
standards, technical reports,
and recommended best practices
by studying documents
prepared by NISO and 
its members, and
component technologies
such as:

- OpenURL link resolvers
- Access and authentication technologies:
    - EZProxy
    - OpenAthens

We also learned about:

* technical and workflow standards

And we discussed:

* why standards are important, whether they are technical or address workflows,
* why interoperability is required, and
* what happens when access to electronic resources break.

## Readings

This week things will start
to make connections
at a faster pace.
In the first
[Anderson article (chapter 2)][anderson2014a],
we gain a clearer idea
of what a knowledge base is and
how it works.
We learn more about
how integrated library systems and
ERM systems work together (or fail to).
We dip our toes
into newer topics
like licensing, COUNTER, and SUSHI,
which we'll cover in
greater detail towards
the end of this work.

In the second
[Anderson article (chapter 3)][anderson2014b],
we learn how to 
carefully consider a
library's work flow before
selecting which ERM
software to purchase.
(This is why workflow-based
standards are important,
even if they are
not true technical standards.)
We do this because
we select systems
based on the needs
of the librarians,
which may be vastly
different across libraries, and
which must rely on different
aspects of the overall process.
As you read this chapter,
keep in mind
the [Samples and Healy][samples2014]
article from the
previous section and the
discussions of proactive versus
reactive troubleshooting.

As hinted at in these readings,
especially in the
section on acquisitions,
budgets, subscriptions, and
purchasing in Anderson's paper on the
[Elements of Electronic Resource Management][anderson2014a],
and in the
multiple discussions about
the role vendors play
in electronic resource management,
the market and the economics
of this area of
librarianship weigh heavily
on everyday realities.
We will follow up on
this in the next section when we
begin to read more about
the market and the economics
of electronic resources.
For example,
in both Anderson
readings,
we learn about the
CORE recommended practice (RP), or the
[Cost of Resource Exchange][cost_exchange],
that was developed by NISO.
CORE brings together
three aspects of our
previous discussions:
software, funds, and interoperability.
Here the *CORE RP* describes
how the ILS and ERM systems
can communicate the
costs of electronic resources
between each other.
Its existence hints at
the pressures librarians
have had in having
to deal with
complex budget issues.
Although these articles were
published before the pandemic,
the pandemic has made these issues more
complicated for libraries.

While we spent time
discussing technical standards,
we also learned about [TERMS][terms2],
an attempt to standardize
the language and processes
involved with
electronic resource management.
We see more connections
in this week's readings.
Aside from the CORE standard,
we learn about
standardizing attempts at licensing,
which includes the *COUNTER* and *SUSHI*
usage-related standards
that outline the
communication, collection, presentation, and
the formatting of usage statistics
for electronic resources
such as ebooks,
journals, databases, and more.

We have discussed interoperability and
what it takes for
multiple systems to
connect and transfer content
between each other.
We primarily discussed this with
respect to link resolver technology,
and we did this not just
because we should know about
link resolvers as important
components of
electronic resource management, but
also because link resolvers
are a good example
of the kind of work
that is involved for
systems to communicate properly.
There are other forms of
interoperability, though, and
coming back to
[CORE][cost_exchange] again,
the [Anderson article (chapter 2)][anderson2014b]
provides a link to a
[white paper][medeiros2008]
on the interoperability
of acquisitions modules between 
integrated library systems and
electronic resource management systems.
This paper defines 
13 data elements that were
determined to be desired in
any exchange between
ILS software and ERM software
for these software to
communicate usefully
with each other.
By that, I mean, the
data points enable meaningful
use of both the ILS software and
the ERM software, and include:

* purchase order number
* price
* start/end dates
* vendor
* vendor ID
* invoice number
* fund code
* invoice date
* selector
* vendor contact information
* purchase order note
* line item note
* invoice note (Medeiros, 2008).

That white paper contains
example and worthwhile
use cases and
stories from major libraries, and
these cases are
rather helpful reads.
This paper is well worth
reading to get
a sense of how standards
are created through a
process of comparing,
contrasting, and coordinating needs and
contexts among different entities.

These Anderson readings are
great because they illustrate
the whole ERM process.
If you are able,
visit the journal issue
for these two readings
and read the
other chapters that
Anderson has written,
but in particular, the
[Electronic Resource Management Systems and Related Products][anderson2014c].

In short,
this section's topic 
provides a foundation
for the remaining topics 
we study.
In particular, 
they will help frame what
we learn when we study
the markets and economics
of the electronic resource industry,
the process of licensing and negotiation, and
about the evaluation and statistics of usage.
Think of this section 
as a foundation and as a
transition between
all we have studied thus far,
and what we study going forward.
